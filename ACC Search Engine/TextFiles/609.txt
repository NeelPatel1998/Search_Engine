QuartzJobScheduling is an open-source job scheduling library. It has a rich set of features that can integrate into our Java applications virtually. We can integrate it with either a stand-alone application or the largest e-commerce system. Quartz is used for creating complex schedules having tens-of-thousands of jobs. The quartz scheduler supports several enterprise-class features, including clustering and JTA transaction. If our Java application has some tasks that are required to occur at a specified time or if our system recurring maintenance jobs, Quartz may be our ideal solution. These are the following uses of the Quartz scheduler in Java: Quartz scheduler allows an enterprise to schedule a job at a specified date and time. It allows us to perform the operations to schedule or unschedule the jobs. It provides operations to start or stop or pause the scheduler. It also provides reminder services. It provides maintenance of the system every business day at 11:30 PM. Features of Quartz scheduler The Quartz scheduler has the following features which make it so useful to integrate into Java applications: 1) Runtime Environment We can run the Quartz embedded in another free-standing application and can be instantiated within the application server. As a cluster of stand-alone programs, it can also be run to execute the jobs. The Quartz can also participate in XA transactions. As a stand-alone application, the quarts can be run to use via RMI. 2) Job Scheduling Jobs scheduling is another feature of Quartz. We can schedule the jobs by using Quartz. We schedule the jobs to run when the specified trigger is fired. The jobs are added to the scheduler once, but they are registered with multiple triggers. 3) Job execution Any Java class that implements the Job interface is referred to as Job interface. These classes are executed by creating an instance of that Job class. The instance of that class can be instantiated by our application frameworks or Quartz. The scheduler notifies Java objects implementing TriggerListener and JobListener interfaces when a trigger is fired, and after the execution of the Jobs, these listeners are also notified. The Jobs returns the JobCompletionCode to notify the scheduler about the success or failure of the Job. 4) Job Persistence Quartz jobs are persistent because Quartz library has a JobStore interface, which is very helpful to store the jobs. It provides a list of mechanisms to store them in the database. Jobs and triggers that are configured as "non-volatile" are stored in the relational database by using JDBCJobStore. The Quartz library provides the RAMJobStore interface that stores all the triggers and jobs in RAM. 5) Transaction With the help of the JobStoreCMT, Quartz participates in the JTA transaction. It manages JTA transactions to automatically happens the work performed by the Job within a JTA transaction. 6) Clustering Load balancing. Fail-over. Let's take an example to understand how we can implement the scheduler application with Quartz. In our example, we fire a job that invokes a business-related task every time. The program starts the Quartz scheduler and schedule job to run every minute. In order to create the Quartz scheduler program, we have to add the following dependencies in our POM.xml file. 
<!-- dependency for Quartz scheduler -->
<dependency>
        <groupId> org.quartz-scheduler </groupId>
        <artifactId> quartz </artifactId>
        <version> 2.2.1 </version>
</dependency>
<!-- dependency for log4j -->
<dependency>
      <groupId> log4j </groupId>
      <artifactId> log4j </artifactId>
      <version> 1.2.16 </version>
</dependency>
 CreateQuartzJob.java 
//import package
package JavaTpoint.JavaObjectToJSON;

//import classes
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.quartz.Job;
import org.quartz.JobExecutionContext;
import org.quartz.JobExecutionException;

//create CreateQuartzJob class that implements Job
public class CreateQuartzJob implements Job{
	
	//Create instance of logger
	private Logger log = Logger.getLogger(CreateQuartzJob.class);
	
	//execute Job by using execute() method of the Job interface
	public void execute(JobExecutionContext jExeCtx) throws JobExecutionException {//handle JobExecutionException
		
		//debug message 
		log.debug("CreateQuartzJob is running......");
	}
}
 Now, in order to schedule a Job, we have to create a scheduler application or Quartz scheduler application. There are five steps to schedule a job to run the task every time. These steps are as follows: In the first step, we have to initialize the scheduler instance from Quartz by using StdSchedulerFactory() method. After that, we start the scheduler instance with the Quartz API start() method. Start the scheduler instance with Quartz API start() Next, we create a scheduler trigger by using the SimpleScheduleBuilder from the Quartz TriggerBuilder with an interval of 1 minute. For the CreateQuartzJob, we build an instance of JobDetail from the Quartz JobBuilder. In the last step, we schedule a job with the instance of the JobDetail and trigger created before. Let's follow the steps discussed above and implement the code to understand how the Quartz scheduler actually works. QuartzScheduler.java 
package JavaTpoint.JavaObjectToJSON;

import org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator;
//import org.quartz.CronScheduleBuilder;
import org.quartz.JobBuilder;
import org.quartz.JobDetail;
import org.quartz.Scheduler;
import org.quartz.SimpleScheduleBuilder;
import org.quartz.Trigger;
import org.quartz.TriggerBuilder;
import org.quartz.impl.StdSchedulerFactory;
 

public class QuartzScheduler {
 
    
	private static final String NAME_OF_JOB = "Job1";
	private static final String NAME_OF_GROUP = "group1";
    private static final String NAME_OF_TRIGGER = "triggerStart";
    
    //create variable scheduler of type Scheduler
    private static Scheduler scheduler;
    
    //main() method starts with exception handling 
    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
    	
    	BasicConfigurator.configure();
    	
    	//show message to know about the main thread 
        System.out.println(" The name of the QuartzScheduler main thread is: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        
        //initialize scheduler instance from Quartz
        scheduler = new StdSchedulerFactory().getScheduler();
        
        //start scheduler
        scheduler.start();
        
        //create scheduler trigger based on the time interval
        Trigger triggerNew =  createTrigger();
        
        //create scheduler trigger with a cron expression
        //Trigger triggerNew = createCronTrigger();
        
        //schedule trigger
        scheduleJob(triggerNew);
 
    }
    
    //create scheduleJob() method to schedule a job
    private static void scheduleJob(Trigger triggerNew) throws Exception {
    	
    	//create an instance of the JoDetails to connect Quartz job to the CreateQuartzJob
        JobDetail jobInstance = JobBuilder.newJob(CreateQuartzJob.class).withIdentity(NAME_OF_JOB, NAME_OF_GROUP).build();
        
        //invoke scheduleJob method to connect the Quartz scheduler to the jobInstance and the triggerNew
        scheduler.scheduleJob(jobInstance, triggerNew);
 
    }
    
    //create createTrigger() method that returns a trigger based on the time interval
    /*private static Trigger createCronTrigger() {
    	
    	//create cron expression
        String CRON_EXPRESSION = "0 * * * * ?";
        
        //create a trigger to be returned from the method
        Trigger triggerNew = TriggerBuilder.newTrigger().withIdentity(NAME_OF_TRIGGER, NAME_OF_GROUP)
                .withSchedule(CronScheduleBuilder.cronSchedule(CRON_EXPRESSION)).build();
        
        //return triggerNew to schedule it in main() method
        return triggerNew;
    }
    */
    
    //create createTrigger() method that returns a trigger based on the time interval
    private static Trigger createTrigger() {
 
        //initialize time interval
    	int TIME_INTERVAL = 60;
    	
    	//create a trigger to be returned from the method
        Trigger triggerNew = TriggerBuilder.newTrigger().withIdentity(NAME_OF_TRIGGER, NAME_OF_GROUP)
                .withSchedule(
                        SimpleScheduleBuilder.simpleSchedule().withIntervalInSeconds(TIME_INTERVAL).repeatForever())
                .build();
        
        // triggerNew to schedule it in main() method
        return triggerNew;
    }
}
 When we run the QuartzScheduler.java class, we will see the output like as: The CreateQuartzJob repeatedly runs every 60 seconds within a different thread. The QuartzScheduler schedules the Job and gives the respective result. Next TopicRed Black Tree Java ? prev next ?
