The multi-threading environment leads to a problem when concurrency is unified. The shared entity such as objects and variables may be changed during the execution of the program. Hence, they may lead to inconsistency of the program. So, it is important to take care of the shared entity while accessing concurrently. In such cases, the atomic variable can be a solution to it. In this section, we will discuss atomic classes, atomic variables, atomic operations, along with examples. Before moving ahead in this section, ensure that you are aware of thread, synchronization, and lock in Java. Java Atomic Classes Java provides a java.util.concurrent.atomic package in which atomic classes are defined. The atomic classes provide a lock-free and thread-safe environment or programming on a single variable. It also supports atomic operations. All the atomic classes have the get() and set() methods that work on the volatile variable. The method works the same as read and writes on volatile variables. The package provides the following atomic classes: Class Description AtomicBoolean It is used to update boolean value atomically. AtomicInteger It is used to update integer value atomically. AtomicIntegerArray An int array in which elements may be updated atomically. AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater A reflection-based utility that enables atomic updates to designated volatile int fields of designated classes. AtomicLong It is used to update long value atomically. AtomicLongArray A long array in which elements may be updated atomically. AtomicLongFieldUpdater A reflection-based utility that enables atomic updates to designated volatile long fields of designated classes. AtomicMarkableReference An AtomicMarkableReference maintains an object reference along with a mark bit, that can be updated atomically. AtomicReference An object reference that may be updated atomically. AtomicReferenceArray An array of object references in which elements may be updated atomically. AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater A reflection-based utility that enables atomic updates to designated volatile reference fields of designated classes. AtomicStampedReference An AtomicStampedReference maintains an object reference along with an integer "stamp", that can be updated atomically. DoubleAccumulator One or more variables that together maintain a running double value updated using a supplied function. DoubleAdder One or more variables that together maintain an initially zero double sum. LongAccumulator One or more variables that together maintain a running long value updated using a supplied function. LongAdder One or more variables that together maintain an initially zero long sum. Objects of these classes represent the atomic variable of int, long, boolean, and object reference respectively. The atomic classes have some common methods are as follows: Methods Description set() It is used to set the value. get() It is used to get the current value. lazySet() Eventually sets to the given value. compareAndSet Atomically sets the value to the given updated value if the current value == the expected value. Atomic Operations Those operations that always execute together is known as the atomic operations or atomic action. All the atomic operations either execute effectively happens all at once or it does not happen at all. Three key concepts are associated with atomic actions in Java are as follows: 1. Atomicity deals with which actions and sets o actions have invisible For example, consider the following code snippet: 
class NoAtomicOps
{
long counter=0;
void increment()
{
for(;;)
{
count++;
}
}
void decrement()
{
for(;;)
{
count--;
}
}
//other statement
}
 In the above code, the behavior of running increment() and decrement() concurrently is undefined and not predictable. 2. Visibility determines when the effect of one thread can be seen by another. For example, consider the following code snippet: 
class InfiniteLoop
{
boolean done= false;
void work()
{
//thread T2 read
while(!done)
{
//do work
}
}
void stopWork()
{
//thread T1 write
done=true;
}
//statements
}
 In the above code, it is possible that thread T2 will never stop even after thread T1 sets done to true. Also, not that there is no synchronization between threads. 3. Ordering determines when actions in one thread occur out of order with respect to another thread. 
class Order
{
boolean a=false;
boolean b=false;
void demo1()  //thread T1
{
a=true;
b=true;
}
boolean demo2()  //thread T2
{
boolean r1=b;	//sees true
boolean r2=a;	//sees false
boolean r3=a;	//sees true	
//returns true
return (r1 && !r2) && r3;
}
}
 The order that fields a and b appear in thread T2 may differ from the order they were set in Thread T1. Let's understand it through an example. 
public class AtomicExample
{
int count;
public void incrementCount()
{
count=1;
}
 In the above code snippet, we have declared an int type variable count and inside the method incrementCount() assigned it to 1. In such a case, either all happen together or would not happen at all. Hence, it represents an atomic operation and the operation is known as atomicity. Let's consider another code snippet. 
public class AtomicExample
{
int count;
public void incrementCount()
{
count=count+1;
}
 It seems that it is also an atomic operation but not so. It is a linear-operation that consists of three operations i.e. read, modify, and write. Therefore, it can execute partially. But if we are using the above code in a multi-threaded environment, it creates a problem. Suppose, we have called the above code in a single-threaded environment, the updated value of count will be 2. If we call the above method by two separate threads, they both access the variable at the same time and also update the value of count simultaneously. To avoid this situation, we use atomic operation. Java supports several types of atomic actions, are as follows: Volatile variables Low-level atomic operations (unsafe) Atomic classes Let's see how can we create an atomic operation. Atomic Variable The atomic variable allows us to perform an atomic operation on a variable. Atomic variables minimize synchronization and help avoid memory consistency errors. Hence, it ensures synchronization. The atomic package provides the following five atomic variables: AtomicInteger AtomicLong AtomicBoolean AtomicIntegerArray AtomicLongArray The Need of Atomic Variable Let's consider the following code. Counter.java 
class Counter extends Thread 
{ 
// Counter Variable 
int count = 0; 
//the method starts the execution of a thread
public void run() 
{ 
int max = 1; 
//increments the counter variable up to specified max time
for (int i = 0; i < max; i++) 
{ 
count++; 
} 
} 
} 
public class Counter 
{ 
public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException 
{ 
//creating an instance of the Counter class 
Counter c = new Counter(); 
//creating four threads
Thread t1 = new Thread(c, "First"); 
Thread t2 = new Thread(c, "Second"); 
Thread t3 = new Thread(c, "Third"); 
Thread t4 = new Thread(c, "Fourth"); 
//by calling the start() method, we have started the thread
t1.start(); 
t2.start(); 
t3.start(); 
t4.start(); 
//main thread will wait for all the four threads until the execution of all threads do not complete
t1.join(); 
t2.join();
t3.join(); 
t4.join(); 
//prints the final value of count variable
System.out.println(c.count);
} 
}
 Output: 
4
 The above program gives the expected output if it is executed in a single-threaded environment. A multi-threaded environment may lead to unexpected output. The reason behind it that when two or more threads try to update the value at the same time then it may not update properly. Java offers two solutions to overcome this problem: By using lock and synchronization By using atomic variable Let's create a Java program and use an atomic variable to overcome the problem. By using Atomic Variable AtomicExample.java 
class Counter extends Thread 
{ 
// Counter Variable 
int count = 0; 
//the method starts the execution of a thread
public void run() 
{ 
int max = 1; 
//increments the counter variable up to specified max time
for (int i = 0; i < max; i++) 
{ 
count++; 
} 
} 
} 
public class Counter 
{ 
public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException 
{ 
//creating an instance of the Counter class 
Counter c = new Counter(); 
//creating four threads
Thread t1 = new Thread(c, "First"); 
Thread t2 = new Thread(c, "Second"); 
Thread t3 = new Thread(c, "Third"); 
Thread t4 = new Thread(c, "Fourth"); 
//by calling the start() method, we have started the thread
t1.start(); 
t2.start(); 
t3.start(); 
t4.start(); 
//main thread will wait for all the four threads until the execution of all threads do not complete
t1.join(); 
t2.join();
t3.join(); 
t4.join(); 
//prints the final value of count variable
System.out.println(c.count);
} 
}
 Output: 
4
 Synchronized Vs. Atomic Vs. Volatile Synchronized Atomic Volatile It applies to methods only. It applies to variables only. It also applies to variables only. It ensures visibility along with atomicity. It also ensures visibility along with atomicity. It ensures visibility, not atomicity. We can't achieve the same. We can't achieve the same. It stores in RAM, so accessing volatile variables is fast. But it does not provide thread-safety and synchronization. It can be implemented as a synchronized block or a synchronized method. We can't achieve the same. We can't achieve the same. It can lock the same class object or a different class object. We can't achieve the same. We can't achieve the same.
