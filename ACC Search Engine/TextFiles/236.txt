Our Digital Image Processing Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. Digital Image Processing is used to manipulate the images by the use of algorithms. For processing digital images the most common software that used widely is Adobe Photoshop. Our Digital Image Processing Tutorial includes all topics of Digital Image Processing such as introduction, computer graphics, signals, photography, camera mechanism, pixel, transaction, types of Images, etc. What is Digital Image Processing (DIP)? Digital Image Processing (DIP) is a software which is used to manipulate the digital images by the use of computer system. It is also used to enhance the images, to get some important information from it. For example: Adobe Photoshop, MATLAB, etc. It is also used in the conversion of signals from an image sensor into the digital images. A certain number of algorithms are used in image processing. Digital Image Processing Digital Image Processing is a software which is used in image processing. For example: computer graphics, signals, photography, camera mechanism, pixels, etc. Digital Image Processing provides a platform to perform various operations like image enhancing, processing of analog and digital signals, image signals, voice signals etc. It provides images in different formats. Digital Image Processing allows users the following tasks Image sharpening and restoration: The common applications of Image sharpening and restoration are zooming, blurring, sharpening, grayscale conversion, edges detecting, Image recognition, and Image retrieval, etc. Medical field: The common applications of medical field are Gamma-ray imaging, PET scan, X-Ray Imaging, Medical CT, UV imaging, etc. Remote sensing: It is the process of scanning the earth by the use of satellite and acknowledges all activities of space. Machine/Robot vision: It works on the vision of robots so that they can see things, identify them, etc. Characteristics of Digital Image Processing It uses software, and some are free of cost. It provides clear images. Digital Image Processing do image enhancement to recollect the data through images. It is used widely everywhere in many fields. It reduces the complexity of digital image processing. It is used to support a better experience of life. Advantages of Digital Image Processing Image reconstruction (CT, MRI, SPECT, PET) Image reformatting (Multi-plane, multi-view reconstructions) Fast image storage and retrieval Fast and high-quality image distribution. Controlled viewing (windowing, zooming) Disadvantages of Digital Image Processing It is very much time-consuming. It is very much costly depending on the particular system. Qualified persons can be used.
