In computing, an emulator is software or hardware that allows one computer system (host) to function like another computer system. Usually, it allows the host machine to run software or use guest system-designed peripheral devices. Emulation is termed as the ability of a computer programme to replicate (or imitate) another programme or system within an electronic device. For example, several printers are designed to imitate HP LaserJet printers since so much software for HP printers is written. If a non-branded printer emulates with a branded printer, the non-branded printer emulation can also run any programme written for a real branded printer and it can even generate the equivalent printing. In order to play classic or forgotten arcade games that were once used to established the market of gaming industry. Many video games fans have been using emulators since 1990s. Before 1980, using the original computer code and data of the games is interpreted by a current-era device and emulates old video game consoles. It can, however, be very difficult in practise, particularly when the exact behaviour of the device to be emulated is not recorded and must be deduced by reverse engineering. In preservation In the process of digital preservation, the emulation is a technique for overcoming obsolescence. The main focus is on the recreation of an original computer environment which is done because of its true desire to retain a closer relation to the maintain the authenticity of a digital object. Further which can be time-consuming and difficult to accomplish, but it returns to be very useful. The process of emulation addresses the digital object's original hardware. Practically speaking, when a new version of a specific application is launched, instead of fixing compatibility problems and migration for any digital object created in the previous version of that application, an application emulator may be created to allow access to all of those digital objects. Advantages of Emulator It certainly has some very major benefits. These points are not the only points but will surlily serve the purpose. And by keeping these points that are mentioned below, we can easily know the benefit of the emulator. Some of the benefit of using the emulator are- Potentially better than original hardware graphics output. Initial hardware does not have added features. Emulators retain the digital object's original look, feel, and behaviour, which is almost as significant as the digital data itself. It helps in reducing the working hours because of the pre stored libraries. The Emulator has been developed and released through the open-source environment. So, the Emulator comes usually under the General Public License which is abbreviated as GPL for the short. Licencing allows the one for broad scale collaboration. Emulators make it possible to use software exclusive to one device on another. Obstacles of Emulator Everything that has some benefit and is successful, it also has some of the obstacles also. The developer needs to focus on these points specially to make the product better. A few obstacles so far are - Intellectual property - During programme growth, several technology vendors introduced non-standard features to create their position in the market, while simultaneously applying ongoing updates to stay competitive. Copyright protections make the design of emulators more difficult, as they must be sufficiently accurate to prevent triggering protections, the consequences of which might not be apparent. Emulators need better hardware than they did with the original setup. The Use of Emulator in Media and its benefit By owing to the primary use of digital formats, the new media art relies heavily on emulation as a preservation technique. In their artwork, artists such as Cory Arcangel specialise in resurrecting outdated technology and understand the value of a decentralised and deinstitutionalized mechanism for digital culture preservation. In certain ways, the purpose of new media art emulation is to maintain a digital format such that it can be stored forever and replicated without mistake, such that hardware that ages and becomes redundant is not reliant. But there is a paradox also associated with it that is that it is important that the emulation and the simulator must work on future computers. Systems Design in Future During the design and implementation of new technologies, emulation techniques are widely used. Even before the system is actually designed, it eases the development process by having the ability to identify, restore and fix design flaws. Most emulators simply imitate a hardware architecture, which must also be supported if the operating system firmware or software is needed for the desired software (and may itself be emulated). Any other hardware must also be provided in virtual form, apart from this interpreter for the language of the emulated binary machine; for example, if writing to a particular memory location could affect what is shown on the computer, it will need to be emulated. Embedded machine software developers or video game consoles often build their software on particularly precise emulators called simulators before they test it on actual hardware. The simulator is actually developed in several instances by the company supplying the hardware, which theoretically improves its accuracy. If a math coprocessor is not installed or present on the CPU, it will render a decided interrupt (coprocessor not available) when the CPU executes some co-processor instructions, calling the routines of the math emulator. Emulator Structure An emulator is usually divided into modules that correspond loosely to the subsystems of the emulated computer. The most important parts are - A memory Unit which will used to store the applications A CPU emulator or CPU simulator input/output (I/O) device emulators Buses are often not emulated, either for reasons of performance or convenience, and the CPU or memory subsystem interacts directly with virtual peripherals.
