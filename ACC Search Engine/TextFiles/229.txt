What is Rhombus? A rhombus is a polygon, whose all four sides is equal in length and opposite side is parallel. 
Area of Rhombus = ( d1 * d2 ) / 2
Where, d1 and d2 are the two diagonals of rhombus. 
 Program of calculating the area of a rhombus in different Programming languages Program 1: Write a Program in C language: 
// This a C program which uses a function to find the area of a rhombus.
#include <stdio.h> // Function to find area 
float findAreaofrhombus(float d1, float d2) 
{ 
float Area_of_rhombus;
Area_of_rhombus= ( d1 * d2 ) / 2; // It is a formula for calculating a area of rhombus 
return (Area_of_rhombus); 
} 
int main() 
{ 
float d1, d2; 
printf("Enter the 1st diagonal of the rhombus:"); 
scanf("%f",&d1);
printf("Enter the 2nd diagonal of the rhombus:");
scanf("%f",&d2);
printf("Area of the rhombus is: %.2f", findAreaofrhombus(d1, d2));   
return 0; 
}
 Output of Above C program: 
Enter the 1st diagonal of the rhombus:5
Enter the 2nd diagonal of the rhombus:10
Area of the rhombus is: 25.0
 Program 2: Write a Program in Java language: 
// This a  Java program which calculates the area of a rhombus.
class findarea { 
static int findAreaofrhombus(int d1, int d2) 
{ 
int Area_of_rhombus;
Area_of_rhombus= ( d1 * d2 ) / 2; // It is a formula for calculating the area of rhombus 
return(Area_of_rhombus); 
} 

// Driver method 
public static void main(String[] args) 
{ 
int d1 = 20;
int d2 = 40; 
System.out.println("The Area of a rhombus in Java:");
System.out.println(findAreaofrhombus(d1, d2)); 
} 
}
 Output of Above Java program: 
The Area of a rhombus in Java:
400
 Program 3: Write a Program in PHP programming language. 
<?php 
// This a  PHP program which calculates the area of a rhombus.  
// Function to find area 
function findAreaofrhombus($d1, $d2) 
{         
$Area_of_rhombus = ( $d1 * $d2 ) / 2; // It is a formula which calculates the area  and store the value in the area variable. 
return ($Area_of_rhombus); 
} 

$d1 = 80;  
$d2= 30; 

echo findAreaofrhombus($d1, $d2); 

?>
 Output of Above PHP program: 
1200
 Program 4: Write a Program in Python programming language. 
# This is a python program which calculates the area of a rhombus. 
# It is a function to calculate the area of rhombus
def findAreaofrhombus(d1, d2):
    return ( ( d1 * d2 ) / 2) # It is a formula which adds the three side and # then return the value to the statement of calling fucntion. 
d1 =30
d2= 40
print(findAreaofrhombus(d1,d2))
 Output of Above Python program: 
600.0
