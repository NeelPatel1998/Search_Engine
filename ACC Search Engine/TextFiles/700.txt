SVN Tutorial SVN tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SVN. Our SVN tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. SVN is an open-source centralized version control system that is available for everyone at zero cost. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among programmers. The version control allows you to track and work together with your team members at the same workspace. This tutorial helps you to understand the Centralized version control system. The examples were done on windows, but should also work on other operating systems like Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac. What is SVN (Subversion)? SVN stands for Subversion. It is called as SVN because of its commands (its command name svn). It is a centralized version control system. It is an open-source tool for version control. SVN is used to manage the current and previous versions of files like source code, documentation, and files. It acts as the time machine for the developers and allows them to go back and browse the history of the project. Some other popular version control systems like Git are in trend now, but there are a large number of projects that are still running on the Subversion. Subversion is open-source and comes under the Apache License, and it was developed by CollabNet Inc in 2000. It was operated much like CVS (Concurrent versions system). In 2009, Apache Incubator accepted it and made it a top-level apache product. Features of SVN The features of SVN are as follows: It supports atomic commits (Either it will occur or not). It keeps a full revision history. It supports Internationalized program message. It provides file locking for the files that cannot be merged. It provides versioning of symbolic links. It supports path-based authorization. It has language bindings for some programming languages like C#, Perl, Ruby, PHP, Python, and Java. It has a standalone server option (svnserver). Components of SVN There are two core components of SVN; they are as follows: SVN server SVN client These components can be considered as web servers and web browsers. The client acts as the browser that accesses the data on the server. SVN Server: It is a tool that is installed in the user machine. It can store or hold the entire project CRS in the centralized remote device. The server operates on the central master copy of your projects in a database.

Prerequisites SVN is not a programming language, so you don't need to much worry about essential knowledge. You have a basic understanding of Windows commands. Windows Command same goes for SVN also. In SVN, You are going to handle all levels of programming-based projects. So it will be better to have some amount of exposure to the software development life cycle (SDLC) and working knowledge of developing web-based and non-web-based applications.
