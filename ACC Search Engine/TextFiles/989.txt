It is also called batteries included framework because Django provides built-in features for everything including Django Admin Interface, default database – SQLlite3, etc. When you’re building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made components to use and that too for rapid development. Why Django Framework ? Excellent documentation and high scalability. Used by Top MNCs and Companies, such as Instagram, Disqus, Spotify, Youtube, Bitbucket, Dropbox, etc. and the list is never-ending. Easiest Framework to learn, rapid development and Batteries fully included. The last but not least reason to learn Django is Python, Python has huge library and features such as Web Scrapping, Machine Learning, Image Processing, Scientific Computing, etc. One can integrate it all this with web application and do lots and lots of advance stuff.
