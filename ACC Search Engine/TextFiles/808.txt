It represents the detailed description of the application and its flow. It is a solution to a problem that can be used in many different situations. It boosts-up the development process by providing a tested proven development paradigm. In this section, we will focus only on visitor design patterns in Java. Visitor Pattern It is a type of behavioral design pattern. It manages algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects. It is used to perform an operation on a group of similar kinds of Objects at runtime. It decouples the operations from an object structure. Using visitor patterns, we can easily add new behaviors to the existing class hierarchy without changing the existing code. Sometimes, it is also known as a behavioral pattern. These design patterns provide all about class object communication. These are the patterns that are specifically concerned with communication between objects. Therefore, the primary goal of the visitor pattern is to moves the operational logic from the objects to another class. Using visitor patterns, we can achieve the open-close principle. According to the GoF, the visitor design pattern is defined as: Representing an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. The following figure describes the concept of visitor design patterns. The visitor pattern actually creates an external class that uses data in other classes. We can use the pattern when we need to perform operations across a dispate set of objects. It provides additional functionality to the class without modifying it. There are the two most important methods that are used in visitor patterns. The accept() method accepts a visitor. It is provided by the Visitable class. The visit() method is called every time when we visit an element. It is implemented by the Visitor class. Example of Visitor Design Pattern The most common example of visitor pattern is shopping in the supermarket. In the supermarket, we pick the goods and add them to our cart. When we collect all the necessary goods to the cart, we go to the bill desk for billing. The cashier checks all the goods picked by us and tells us the total amount; we have to pay. Here, the cashier acts as a visitor. Where and when to use it? We should use a visitor design pattern if the application holds the following conditions: If we have a well-defined set of classes that are to be visited. Operations on said classes are not well-defined or known in advance. For example, if someone is consuming your API and you want to give consumers a way to add new ad-hoc functionality to objects. They're also a convenient way to extend sealed classes with ad-hoc functionality. You perform operations of a class of objects and want to avoid run-time type testing. This is usually the case when you traverse a hierarchy of disparate objects having different properties. Design Components There are five major components of visitor pattern: Client: It is a class that acts as a consumer of the classes of the design pattern. It has the authority to access the data structure objects. It also instructs them to accept a Visitor that performs the appropriate processing. Visitor: It may be an interface or an abstract class. The interface contains the visit operation for all types of visitable classes. ConcreteVisitor: All the visit methods that are declared in abstract visitor must be implemented in the ConcreteVisitor class. Each visitor is responsible for different operations. Visitable: It is also an interface in which we declare the accepted operation. It is an entry point that enables an object to be visited by the visitor object. ConcreteVisitable: It is a class that implements the Visitable interface or class in which accept operation is defined. The object of the visitor class is passed through the object of using the accept operation. Advantages We can easily add items to the system. The changes are required only in the Visitor interface. Other existing code will not be affected. If the logic of operation changes, then we need to make changes only in the visitor implementation. It reduces the maintenance cost. Being relatively clean, easy-to-read code. Type-safety, type errors are caught at compile time. It provides high extensibility. Disadvantages It is difficult to extend if there are several implementations of the visitor interface. While designing the pattern, emphasis on the return type of the visit() method. Else, we will have to change the interface and all its implementations. Implementation of Visitor Design Pattern in Java Let's design a pattern for the vehicles gone under service and visited by the inspector who calculates the service charge for each vehicle and total service charges including all the vehicles. In the following example, first, we will create two interfaces named Vehicle and VehicleInspector. Vehicle.java 
public interface Vehicle {
//every vehicle goes under full service and the vehicle inspector calculates the total service charge 
    int accept(VehicleInspector vehicleInspector);
}
 VehicleInspector.java 
//vehicle inspector visits all the vehicle 
public interface VehicleInspector {
//visits car
    int visit(Car car);
//visits van
    int visit(Van van);
//visits motor bike
    int visit(Motorbike motorbike);
}
 Here, we will create five Java classes named Car.java, Van.java, Moterbike.java, VehicleInspection.java, and VehicleService.java. The classes Car, Van, and Motorbike implements the Vehicle interface. These are the vehicles going under maintenance. Car.java 
//the class implements the Vehicle interface 
public class Car implements Vehicle{
    private String color;
    private int manufactureDate;
//creating a constructor of the class
    public Car(String color, int manufactureDate) {
        this.color = color;
        this.manufactureDate = manufactureDate;
    }
//creating getters and setters
    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }
    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }
    public int getManufactureDate() {
        return manufactureDate;
    }
    public void setManufactureDate(int manufactureDate) {
        this.manufactureDate = manufactureDate;
    }
//overrides the accept() method of the Vehicle interface
    @Override
    public int accept(VehicleInspector vehicleInspector) {
        return vehicleInspector.visit(this);
    }
}
 Motherbike.java 
//the class implements the Vehicle interface 
public class Motorbike implements Vehicle{
    private int engineCapacity;
    private String brand;
//creating constructor of the class
    public Motorbike(int engineCapacity, String brand) {
        this.engineCapacity = engineCapacity;
        this.brand = brand;
    }
//generating getters and setters
    public int getEngineCapacity() {
        return engineCapacity;
    }
    public void setEngineCapacity(int engineCapacity) {
        this.engineCapacity = engineCapacity;
    }
    public String getBrand() {
        return brand;
    }
    public void setBrand(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }
//overrides the accept() method of the Vehicle interface
    @Override
    public int accept(VehicleInspector vehicleInspector) {
        return vehicleInspector.visit(this);
    }
}
 Van.java 
//the class implements the Vehicle interface
public class Van implements Vehicle{
    private int storageCapacity;
    private int numberOfDoors;
//creating a constructor of the class
    public Van(int storageCapacity, int numberOfDoors) {
        this.storageCapacity = storageCapacity;
        this.numberOfDoors = numberOfDoors;
    }
//generating getters and setters
    public int getStorageCapacity() {
        return storageCapacity;
    }
    public void setStorageCapacity(int storageCapacity) {
        this.storageCapacity = storageCapacity;
    }
    public int getNumberOfDoors() {
        return numberOfDoors;
    }
    public void setNumberOfDoors(int numberOfDoors) {
        this.numberOfDoors = numberOfDoors;
    }
//overrides the accept() method of the Vehicle interface
    @Override
    public int accept(VehicleInspector vehicleInspector) {
        return vehicleInspector.visit(this);
    }
}
 VehicleInspection.java 
//the class implements the VehicleInspector interface
public class VehicleInspection implements VehicleInspector{
//the method returns the total service charge for car visited by the vehicle inspector
    @Override
    public int visit(Car car) {
        int serviceCharge = 0;
        if(car.getColor()=="Black"){
            serviceCharge += 100;
        }else{
            serviceCharge += 50;
        }
        System.out.println("Service Charge for Car: " + serviceCharge);
        return serviceCharge;
    }
//overrides the visit() method of the VehicleInspector interface when the inspector visit the vehicle
//the method returns the total service charge for van visited by the vehicle inspector
    @Override
    public int visit(Van van) {
        int serviceCharge = 0;
        if(van.getNumberOfDoors()>4){
            serviceCharge += 500;
        }else{
            serviceCharge += 100;
        }
        System.out.println("Service Charge for Van: " + serviceCharge);
        return serviceCharge;
    }
//the method returns the total service charge for motorbike visited by the vehicle inspector
    @Override
    public int visit(Motorbike motorbike) {
        int serviceCharge = 0;
        if(motorbike.getEngineCapacity()>=200){
            serviceCharge += 200;
        }else{
            serviceCharge += 50;
        }
        System.out.println("Service Charge for Motorbike: " + serviceCharge);
        return serviceCharge;
    }
}
 VehicleService.java 
public class VehicleService {
//returns the total service charge of all the vehicles that are gone under full service
    private static int calculateTotal(Vehicle[] vehicles) {
        VehicleInspector inspector = new VehicleInspection();
        int total = 0;
        for(Vehicle vehicle : vehicles){
            total = total + vehicle.accept(inspector);
        }
        return total;
    }
//driver code
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle[] vehicles = new Vehicle[]{
                new Car("Black", 2010),
                new Van(5000, 6),
                new Motorbike(100, "TVS")
        };
        int totalCost = calculateTotal(vehicles);
        System.out.println("Total Service Charge: " + totalCost);
    }
}
 When you create all the interfaces and Java classes, the project directory will look something like the following: Output: 
Service Charge for Car: 100
Service Charge for Van: 500
Service Charge for Motorbike: 50
Total Service Charge: 650
 Therefore, the purpose of using visitor patterns is to give all implemented elementary functionalities. It can be used if we required to add infinite numbers of sophisticated functionalities.
