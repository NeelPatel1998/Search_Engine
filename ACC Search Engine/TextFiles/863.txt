Embedded Systems Tutorial Embedded Systems tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Embedded System. Our Embedded System tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. Embedded System is a system composed of hardware, application software and real time operating system. It can be small independent system or large combinational system. Our Embedded System tutorial includes all topics of Embedded System such as characteristics, designing, processors, microcontrollers, tools, addressing modes, assembly language, interrupts, embedded c programming, led blinking, serial communication, lcd programming, keyboard programming, project implementation etc. What is System System is a way of working, organizing or performing one or many tasks according to a fixed set of rules, program or plan. It is an arrangement in which all the unit combined to perform a work together by following certain set of rules in real time computation. It can also be defined as a way of working, organizing or doing one or many tasks according to a fixed plan. What is Embedded System An Embedded System is a system that has software embedded into computer-hardware, which makes a system dedicated for a variety of application or specific part of an application or product or part of a larger system. An embedded system can be a small independent system or a large combinational system. It is a microcontroller-based control system used to perform a specific task of operation. An embedded system is a combination of three major components: Hardware: Hardware is physically used component that is physically connected with an embedded system. It comprises of microcontroller based integrated circuit, power supply, LCD display etc. Application software: Application software allows the user to perform varieties of application to be run on an embedded system by changing the code installed in an embedded system. Real Time Operating system (RTOS): RTOS supervises the way an embedded system work. It act as an interface between hardware and application software which supervises the application software and provide mechanism to let the processor run on the basis of scheduling for controlling the effect of latencies.
