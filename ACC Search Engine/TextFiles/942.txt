PostgreSQL Tutorial PostgreSQL is a popular relational database management system (RDBMS). Our PostgreSQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of PostgreSQL. In this tutorial, we are going to learn all the topics of PostgreSQL language, such as create a database, drop a database, select database, select table, update a record, create a table, delete record, drop table, triggers, functions, insert the record, procedures, cursors, etc. We are also going to provide PostgreSQL interview questions and quizzes to help you better understand the PostgreSQL language. This tutorial will help us to understand all the primary features of PostgreSQL, also provides a knowledge on how to use PostgreSQL. What is PostgreSQL? PostgreSQL is an ORDBMS [Open-Source Object-Relational Database Management System]. It is used to store data securely; supporting best practices, and allow recovering them when the request is processed. PostgreSQL is initially introduced on 8th July 1996 at the University of California. It is the first DBMS, which perform MVCC [Multi-Version Concurrency Control] feature, even before Oracle. The multi-version concurrency control attribute is known as snapshot isolation in Oracle. It is written in C programming language. PostgreSQL is cross-platform and runs on various operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, UNIX, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, HP-UX, LINUX, and so on. The PostgreSQL is the existing database for the macOS server. PostgreSQL is also pronounced as Post-gress-Q-L, which is developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group (a worldwide team of volunteers), any organization or other private entity does not control it. PostgreSQL will offer us the facility to add custom functions with the help of various programming languages such as Java, C, and C++, etc. In this, we can describe our functional languages, index types and data types, and we can also create a custom plugin to increase the reliability of our needs. Its source code is accessible under PostgreSQL license; thus, we can use it freely, change and allocate PostgreSQL in any form. The PostgreSQL follow the transaction along with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties. The primary objective of PostgreSQL is to handle a variety of jobs from single technologies to web service or the data warehouse with several parallel users. History of PostgreSQL PostgreSQL was developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, which is led by a computer science professor named Michael Stonebraker at the University of California, Berkeley [UCB]. The professor's stonebreaker started in 1986 as a follow-up project and a post-Ingres project to overcome the problems of the existing database system. Initially, it was called as Postgres, but in 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL. Then again, in 2007, they did some analysis, and the development team decided to preserve the name as PostgreSQL. And now, it is the most innovative open-source database available in the market. Years Description 1977-1985: In these particular years, the INGRES project is developed. The Ingres Company developed in 1980 and 1994: the computer Associates acquires it. The Ingres project is a proof-of-concept for relational databases. 1986-1994: POSTGRES In INGRES, upgrading the features is essential for object-orientation and the query language Quel. The codebase of INGRES was not used as a basis for POSTGRES. After that, it is commercialized as Illustrate, which is acquired by Informix and IBM. 1994-1995: Postgres95 In 1994, support for SQL was added. In 1995, they released as Postgres95. In 1996, they re-released as PostgreSQL 6.0. The Formation of the PostgreSQL Global Development Team. Note: In 1997, the first PostgreSQL release their designed version 6.0. And later on, the developers throughout the world will continue working on the software as the PostgreSQL Global Development Group. The development will continue creating the releases which are accessible for both open-source software and PostgreSQL License.
