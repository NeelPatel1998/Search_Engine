AutoCAD Tutorial AutoCAD is a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) drafting software, marketed by Autodesk. It is a commercial 2D and 3D drafting software. The AutoCAD software is used for several applications, including floor plan design, blueprints for buildings, bridges, chip design, etc. The AutoCAD was designed to help the users to achieve the realistic appearance of their projects. It is used by professionals in various industries to enhance their design, which increases the quality and productivity of their product. It has also increased the speed of manufacturing of the parts. What is AutoCAD? AutoCAD stands for Autodesk Computer-Aided Design. It is a drafting and design software application developed and marketed by Autodesk. The AutoCAD software is used in industries, by architects, designers, graphic designers, city planners, managers, and other professionals worldwide. The commercial CAD programs were used before the development of AutoCAD. The AutoCAD was run on microcomputers with an internal graphics controller. The commercial CAD programs ran on the minicomputers or mainframe computers, where each CAD operator worked at a separate graphics terminal. The AutoCAD software is available in various languages, namely, English, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Spanish, Albanian, Polish, Russian, Czech, Hungarian, Chinese Simplified and Traditional, and Brazilian Portuguese. The AutoCAD has developed for various programs and fields. Features of AutoCAD The features of AutoCAD are listed below: 3D navigation Visual styles 3D scanning and point clouds Data extraction Section planes Data linking Layouts Tool palettes Express tools Fields Dynamic blocks Command lines Import 3D models User interaction Multifunctional Grips Revision clouds Image references Tables Solid, surface and Mesh modeling Photorealistic rendering Section and Projected views PDF Import and Export Panels Ribbon tabs Isometric view AutoCAD Mobile App Collaboration Parametric constraints 3D Scanning Point clouds Products of AutoCAD Free trials 3D CAD Software 3D Animation 3D Modelling Software 2D CAD Drafting 3D Printing Civil Engineering Construction (US site) Manufacturing (US site) Sketching and Painting Product Design Find by Industry History of AutoCAD The Interact CAD was the first program began in 1977 and released in 1979. The AutoCAD was derived from the Interact CAD program, which is also referred to as MicroCAD in early Autodesk documents. It was written before Autodesk formation.

The 2019 version was marked as the 9th consecutive version for the MAC. The common extension for the file format in AutoCAD is .dwg. The DXF file format has become the de-facto standard for 2D drawing exchange and CAD data interoperability. Prerequisite The requirement to learn AutoCAD is knowledge of Computers fundamentals, creative thinking, and basic designing ideas. It is a design software having different settings and procedures. The basic part of AutoCAD is easy, but the rest is quite complex. Audience AutoCAD is used by graphic designers, architects, engineers, city planners, project managers, professionals, etc. It is designed for beginners as well as professionals to create drawings and realistic models. It is the fast and best CAD software used worldwide. Problem We assure that you will not find any problem with this AutoCAD Tutorial.
