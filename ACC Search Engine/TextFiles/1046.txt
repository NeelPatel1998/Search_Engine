What is advertising? Advertising is a type of marketing communication in which a product, service, or idea is advertised or sells via publicly funded and non-personal advertising. Advertising refers to a marketing strategy in which a known sponsor pays for space and slot to advertise a product. It reaches millions of people at once and draws the target audience's interest that causes them to buy the product. It is a medium of communication that aims to raise awareness, educate and influence people. The main purpose of advertising is to attract new clients while maintaining existing ones by specifying the target audience and targeting them with a convincing yet successful message. In this way, a simple promotional strategy can dramatically affect the customer's purchasing behavior. Characteristics of Advertising The various characteristics of advertising are as follows: Wide applicability Advertising is one of the most commonly used means of mass communication. Not only businesses but ads are often used by political parties for the initiative, charitable donation trusts, educational institutions for admissions, states for tourism, government agencies for awareness-raising, etc. Persuasive The main goal of advertising is to increase the sales of a service or product. The advertising should also convince consumers that the product or service is superior to the competitors. Persuasive advertisement is in a position to ensure that the product will solve the needs of the customer or change the life of the consumer. Investment An investment of resources, time, and money is needed for advertising campaigns. Generally, in return for its distribution, the channel issuing the ads charges a fee. A strong ad campaign would help raise the company's revenues, and this advantage should exceed the costs invested. Advertisers calculate the ROI (Return of Investment) of the campaign to consider the relationship between costs (return of investment). An optimistic ROI means that it has a success for the advertising campaign. One-way communication In advertising, there is only one-way communication, in the sense that companies, through different networks, outlets, or media, convey their message to consumers. Personal and non-personal In earlier days, when conventional advertisement techniques (TV, radio, newspaper) were used, the advertising was extremely non-personal. However, after social media, content-based or cookie-based ads became famous with the advent of digital advertising. Difference in objectives Every company with the same intent does not market the product and service. The rationale for using ads varies from one firm to another. Advertising is used to boost sales, enhance the brand's reputation, develop a strong public partnership, establish a ready demand for a new product, withstand competition or inform individuals. Promotional Advertising is a means of communication at its heart that seeks to publicize a product or service and facilitate sales. A good advertisement is promotional by nature. Although some may confuse ads with "propaganda". Propaganda tries to manipulate the population's ideology and ways of thinking, while advertisement concentrates on manipulating shopping habits. A successful ad is promotional in nature, while this promotion can often be quite subtle.
