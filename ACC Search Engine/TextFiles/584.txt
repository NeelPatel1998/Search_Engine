Under the no-load condition, the current in the line is due to the flow of charge only (Increase Ferranti effect), and the charging current is due to the formation of capacitance between the transmission line and earth. 6) In a synchronous machine, the V curve is drawn between which of the given axis. Field current on X-axis and no-load current on Y-axis Armature current on X-axis and the no-load current in Y-axis Field current on X-axis and armature current on Y-axis Armature current on X-axis and filed current on Y-axis Show Answer Workspace Answer: c Explanation: In the synchronous machine, V curves refer to a graph depicting the relationship between Field current on the X-axis and Armature current on the Y-axis. The graph located above represents the V curve of a synchronous motor. The middle line represents the unity power factor line and the right-hand side of the unity power factor line considered as lagging power factor line. It reduces the external D.C. voltage source using the controlled rectifier, which causes more lagging current to make constant air gaps, and during this process, the field current is kept lower. 7) The spot welding is used for Joint thick sheets Rough surface Thin metal sheets(10-12mm) T shape welding Show Answer Workspace Answer: c Explanation: Spot welding refers to a process of joining two pieces of thin sheet metal and fusing them with the help of copper electrodes, and a high current is passed that heat the two metal pieces causes them to fuse at that point.

If the flux per pole is 0.04 weber, find the emf of the generator. 1600 V 1792 V 1982 V 2020 V Show Answer Workspace Answer: c Explanation: Given; P = 8 N = 1600 rpm Z = 1680 Ø = 0.04 Weber In lap wound generator A=P=8 E ? We know that the emf generated. 52) The input voltage of a boost regulator is 8V, and the average output voltage is 24V. Find the duty cycle. Show Answer Workspace Answer: b Explanation: Given; Vo = 24 V Vs = 8 ? =? We know that, 53) In which of the given single-phase motor, the rotor has no teeth or winding? Shaded pole motor Capacitor start motor A permanent capacitor run the motor Hysteresis motor Show Answer Workspace Answer: d Explanation: Hysteresis motor refers to a synchronous motor with a uniform air gap and starts without D.C. excitation. In this motor, the rotor has no teeth or windings. 54) 1 volt can be expressed as 1 joule/weber 1 joule/ columb 1 joule/ohm 1 watt/ Joule Show Answer Workspace Answer: b Explanation: Voltage can be express as work done per unit charge. Unit of voltage = Joule/ coulomb 55) A single-phase having a rating of 11 kVA, 4400/440 V, 50 Hz, distribution transformer is to be connected as an auto-transformer to get an output voltage of 3260 V. Find its maximum kVA rating as an autotransformer. 111 121 144 169 Show Answer Workspace Answer: b Explanation: We know that voltage rating is additive that is 4400+440 = 4880 V Let a2wdg be the secondary winding of the autotransformer (KVA)auto= (a2wdg + 1) × (KVA) 2wdg = (10+1) × 11 = 11 × 11 = 121 KVA 56) The starting current of a three phase induction motor is 3 times the rated current, while the rated slip is 8 %. Find the ratio of starting toque to full load toque 0.5 0.75 0.72 0.80 Show Answer Workspace Answer: c Explanation: Given; Ist = 3 If Sfl = 8 % = 0.08 We know that, 57) The Ybus matrix of a 200 bus interlinked system is 70 % sparse. Find the number of transmission lines in the system 8100 7200 5900 4700 Show Answer Workspace Answer: c Explanation: Given; Number of buses, N = 200 Sparsity, s = 0.7 We know that, the equation to calculate transmission line NT = N2(1-s) - N / 2 = (200)2(1-0.7)-200 / 2 = 5900 58) A negative sequence really is usually used to protect A transformer An Alternator A transistor A Junction Show Answer Workspace Answer: b Explanation: A negative sequence is referred to a realy that is used to protect an alternator. It refers to a relay that protects the electrical machine from the negative sequence component. 59) A potentiometer is usually a Digital Instrument Deflection type instrument Null type instrument None of these Show Answer Workspace Answer: c Explanation: A potentiometer is usually a null-type instrument. It is an electronic instrument used to find the EMF. 60) An amplifier has a gain of 30 without feedback. If 20 % of the output voltage is a feedback using its resistance negative feedback circuit, find the overall gain? 3.67 4.28 9.85 7.47 Show Answer Workspace Answer: b Explanation: Given; A = 30 And ? = 20 % = 0.2 Because feedback is negative Next TopicClass 12 Physics MCQ ? prev next ?
