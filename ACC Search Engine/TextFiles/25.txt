What is Ellipse? An ellipse is described as a curve on a plane that surrounds two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve. Perimeter of Ellipse 
Perimeter of Ellipse = 2 * ? * sqrt( (a2 + b2) / 2 )
Where, a is the semi-major axis of an ellipse, b is the semi-minor axis of the same ellipse, and the value of ? is 3.14. 
 Program of calculating the perimeter of an ellipse in different Programming languages Program 1: Write a Program in C language: 
// This is a C program which uses a function to find the perimeter of ellipse.
#include <stdio.h>
float find_Perimeter_of_ellipse(float a, float b) // It is a C function to find perimeter 
{ 
float Perimeter_of_ellipse;
Perimeter_of_ellipse= 2 * 3.14 * sqrt( ( (a* a) + (b * b) ) / 2 ); // It is a formula for calculating a perimeter of ellipse 
return (Perimeter_of_ellipse); 
} 
float main() 
{ 
float a; 
float b;
printf("Enter the semi-major axis of the ellipse:"); 
scanf("%f",&a);
printf("Enter the semi-minor axis of the ellipse:"); 
scanf("%f",&b);
printf("Perimeter of the ellipse is: %f", find_Perimeter_of_ellipse(a, b));   
return 0; 
} 
 Output of Above C program: 
Enter the semi-major axis of the ellipse:5
Enter the semi-minor axis of the ellipse:10
Perimeter of the ellipse is: 49.647758
 Program 2: Write a Program in Java language: 
// This is a program written in Java Languages, which finds the perimeter of the ellipse.
import java.lang.Math;
class findperimeter { 
static double find_Perimeter_of_ellipse(float a, float b) 
{  
double Perimeter_of_ellipse;
Perimeter_of_ellipse = 2 * 3.14 * Math.sqrt( ( (a* a) + (b * b) ) / 2);
return(Perimeter_of_ellipse); 
} 
// Driver method 
public static void main(String[] args) 
{ 
float a= 5, b = 10; 
System.out.println("The Perimeter of a ellipse is:");
System.out.println(find_Perimeter_of_ellipse(a, b)); 
} 
}
 Output of Above Java program: 
The Perimeter of a ellipse is:
49.647759264643554
 Program 3: Write a Program in PHP programming language. 
<?php 
// This a  PHP program which finds the perimeter of a ellipse.  
// Function to find perimeter 
function find_Perimeter_of_ellipse($a, $b) 
{   
$Perimeter_of_ellipse = 2 * 3.14 * sqrt( ( ($a* $a) + ($b * $b) ) / 2 ); // It is a formula which finds the perimeter  and store the value in the perimeter_of_ellipse variable. 
return ($Perimeter_of_ellipse); 
} 
$a = 5; 
$b = 10;

echo find_Perimeter_of_ellipse($a, $b); 
?>
 Output of Above PHP program: 
49.647759264644
 Program 4: Write a Program in Python programming language. 
# This is a python program which finds the perimeter of a ellipse. 
# It is a function to find the perimeter of ellipse
from math import sqrt
def find_Perimeter_of_ellipse(a, b):
    return ( 2 * 3.14 * sqrt( ( (a* a) + (b * b) ) / 2 )) # It is a formula which finds the value of perimeter. 
a = 5
b= 10
print(find_Perimeter_of_ellipse(a, b) )
 Output of Above Python program: 
49.647759264644
