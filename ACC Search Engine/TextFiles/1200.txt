Releases of Linux Lite Linux Lite began out along with a number system composed of the below: 1.0.0 The '1' illustrated the base code through Ubuntu i.e., '1' meant that 12.04 LTS base of Ubuntu. The '0' illustrated the interim LTS release of Ubuntu i.e., '0' meant 12.04.1. The last number '0' illustrated the point release. The last number, i.e., '0' was ignored because point release was not needed for the 2.x series.
