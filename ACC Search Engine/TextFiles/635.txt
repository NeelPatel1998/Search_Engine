Before jumping to the function call, we need to understand the function in the C programming language. A function is a group of tasks used to execute the predefined operations and returns a value. A large program can be divided into small blocks of code that help to understand the logic, debug, and modified it. In the C programming language, the function is divided into two parts: the built-in/ library function and the user-defined function. Library/ Built-in Function A library function is predefined functions, and its tasks are also defined in the C header files. So, it does not require writing the code of the particular function; instead, it can be called directly in a program whenever it is required. Example: printf(), scanf(), getch(), etc., are the predefined function in the C library, and the meaning of these functions cannot be changed. Let's write a program to define the library function in C. Predefined.c 
# include <stdio.h> //  Contains the printf, scanf() built-in function
#include <conio.h> 
void main() 
{
printf( " Welcome to the JavaTpoint.com "); 
printf("\n It is the library or built-in function in C "); 
getch(); // built-in function
}
 Output: 
Welcome to the JavaTpoint.com
It is the library function or built-in function in C
 User-defined Function It is a user-defined function in the C programming language to execute some specific actions according to the programmer's requirement. A user-defined function is divided into three types such as function declaration, function definition, and function call. Function Declaration A function declaration defines the name and return type of a function in a program. Before using the function, we need to declare it outside of a main() function in a program. Syntax: 
return_data_type function_name ( data_type arguments) ;
 Example of function declaration: 
int add ( int num1, int num2 );
 In the above example, int is a return data type of the function name add function that contains two integer parameters as num1 and num2. Furthermore, we can write the above function declaration is as follows: 
int add (int, int);
 Function Definition It defines the actual body of a function inside a program for executing their tasks in C. Syntax: 
return_data_type function_name (argument list ) {
// Statement to be executed in a function;
}
 In the above syntax, a function definition contains the three parts as follow: Return Data_Type: It defines the return data type of a value in the function. The return data type can be integer, float, character, etc. Function Name: It defines the actual name of a function that contains some parameters. Parameters/ Arguments: It is a parameter that passed inside the function name of a program. Parameters can be any type, order, and the number of parameters. Function Body: It is the collection of the statements to be executed for performing the specific tasks in a function. Consider an example to demonstrate the function definition: 
int min (int n1, int n2); // min() is the name of a function that contains n1 and n2 parameters
{
// declaration of the local variable.
int out;
if ( n1 > n2) 
out = n1; // return n1 when n1 is greater than n2.
else
out = n2; // return n2 when n2 is greater than n1.
return out;
}
 Function Calling: A function call is an important part of the C programming language. It is called inside a program whenever it is required to call a function. It is only called by its name in the main() function of a program. We can pass the parameters to a function calling in the main() function. Syntax: 
Add(a, b) // a and b are the parameters
 Let's consider a program to call a function in C programming languages. Add.c 
#include <stdio.h>
int add(int a, int b); 
void main()
{

int sum;
int a, b;
printf(" Enter the first and second number \n");
scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
sum = add(a, b); // call add() function
printf( "The sum of the two number is %d", sum);
}
int add(int n1, int n2) // pass n1 and n2 parameter
{
int c;
c = n1 + n2;
return c;
}
 Output: 
Enter the first and second number
5
6
The sum of the two number is 11
 Call by Value: When single or multiple values of an actual argument are copied into the formal parameter of a function, the method is called the Call by Value. Hence, it does not alter the function's actual parameter using the formal parameter. Consider a program to demonstrate the Call by Value in C programming. Call_Value.c 
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int x = 10, y = 20;
printf (" x = %d, y = %d from main before calling the function", x, y);
CallValue(x, y);
printf( "\n x = %d, y = %d from main after calling the function", x, y);
}
int CallValue( int x, int y)
{
x = x + 5;
y = y + 5;
printf (" \nx = %d, y = %d from modular function", x, y);
} 
 Output: 
x = 10, y = 20 from main before calling the function
x = 15, y = 25 from modular function
 x = 10, y = 20 from main after calling the function
 Call by Reference: In this method, the address of the actual argument is copied into the function call's formal parameter; the method is known as Call by Reference. If we make some changes in the formal parameters, it shows the effect in the value of the actual parameter. Consider a program to demonstrate the Call by Reference in C programming. Call_Ref.c 
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int x = 10, y = 20;
printf (" x = %d, y = %d from main before calling the function", x, y);
CallValue (&x, &y);
printf( "\n x = %d, y = %d from main after calling the function", x, y);
}
int CallRef( int *a, int *b)
{
*a = *a + 5;
*b = *b + 5;
printf (" \nx = %d, y = %d from modular function", *a, *b);
}
 Output: 
x = 10, y = 20 from main before calling the function
x = 15, y = 25 from modular function
 x = 15, y = 25 from main after calling the function
