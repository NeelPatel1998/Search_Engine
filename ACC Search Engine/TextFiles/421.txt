As the name suggests, it is used when we have structured data (in the form of tables). All databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do not use SQL, are called NoSQL databases. Examples of NoSQL are MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra, etc ‘Recent Articles’ on SQL Topic: Basics Clauses / Operators Functions Queries SQL-Injection PL/SQL MySQL SQL Server Misc Quick Links Basics: Structured Query Language SQL | Datatypes SQL | DDL, DML, TCL and DCL SQL | TRANSACTIONS SQL | VIEWS SQL | Comments SQL | Constraints SQL | Creating Roles SQL | Indexes SQL | SEQUENCES SQL | Query Processing CTE in SQL SQL Trigger | Student Database Book Management Database Introduction to NoSQL Clauses / Operators: SQL | WITH clause SQL | With Ties Clause SQL | Arithmetic Operators SQL | Wildcard operators SQL | Intersect & Except clause SQL | USING Clause SQL | MERGE Statement MERGE Statement in SQL Explained SQL | DDL, DML, DCL and TCL Commands SQL | CREATE DOMAIN SQL | DESCRIBE Statement SQL | Case Statement SQL | UNIQUE Constraint SQL | Create Table Extension SQL | ALTER (RENAME) SQL | ALTER (ADD, DROP, MODIFY) SQL | LIMIT Clause SQL | INSERT IGNORE Statement SQL | LIKE SQL | SOME SQL | OFFSET-FETCH Clause SQL | Except Clause Combining aggregate and non-aggregate values in SQL using Joins and Over clause SQL | ALL and ANY SQL | EXISTS SQL | GROUP BY SQL | Union Clause SQL | Aliases SQL | ORDER BY SQL | SELECT TOP Clause SQL | UPDATE Statement SQL | DELETE Statement SQL | INSERT INTO Statement SQL | AND and OR operators SQL | WHERE Clause SQL | Distinct Clause SQL | SELECT Query SQL | DROP, TRUNCATE SQL | CREATE SQL | Join (Cartesian Join & Self Join) SQL | Alternative Quote Operator SQL | Concatenation Operator SQL | MINUS Operator SQL | DIVISION SQL | NOT Operator SQL | BETWEEN & IN Operator SQL | Join (Inner, Left, Right and Full Joins) SQL | CHECK Constraint SQL-Injection: SQL Injection How to use SQLMAP to test a website for SQL Injection vulnerability Mitigation of SQL Injection Attack using Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries) Basic SQL Injection and Mitigation with Example Functions: SQL | Mathematical functions (SQRT, PI, SQUARE, ROUND, CEILING & FLOOR) SQL | Conversion Function SQL general functions | NVL, NVL2, DECODE, COALESCE, NULLIF, LNNVL and NANVL SQL | Conditional Expressions SQL | Character Functions with Examples SQL | Date Functions (Set-1) SQL | Date Functions (Set-2) SQL | LISTAGG SQL | Aggregate functions SQL | Functions (Aggregate and Scalar Functions) SQL | Date functions SQL | NULL SQL | Numeric Functions SQL | String functions SQL | Advanced Functions Queries: SQL | Joining three or more tables SQL | How to Get the names of the table SQL | Sub queries in From Clause SQL | Correlated Subqueries SQL | Top-N Queries SQL | SUB Queries SQL | How to print duplicate rows in a table?
