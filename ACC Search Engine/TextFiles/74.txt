Some of the basic data structures are Arrays, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues etc. This page will contain some of the complex and advanced Data Structures like Disjoint Sets, Self-Balancing Trees, Segment Trees, Tries etc. ‘Recent Articles’ Topics: Advanced Lists Segment Tree Trie Binary Indexed Tree Suffix Array and Tree Self-Balancing BSTs K Dimensional Tree Disjoint Set n-ary Tree Others Misc Practice Problems Advanced Lists : Generic Linked List in C Memory efficient Doubly Linked List XOR Linked List | Set 1 XOR Linked List | Set 2 Skip List Self-Organizing List Unrolled Linked List Segment Tree : Sum of given range Range minimum query Lazy Propagation Persistent Segment Tree Efficiently design Insert, Delete and Median queries on a set Range Minimum Query (Square Root Decomposition and Sparse Table) Range LCM queries Min-Max Range queries in array Count and Toggle queries on Binary array Querying maximum number of divisors that a number in a given range has LCA in a binary tree using RMQ GCDs of given index ranges in an array Smallest sub-array with given GCD Largest Rectangular Area in a Histogram Heavy Light Decomposition | Set 1 (Introduction) Heavy Light Decomposition | Set 2 (Implementation) Reconstructing Segment Tree Longest Common Extension / LCE | Set 1 (Introduction and Naive Method) Longest Common Extension / LCE | Set 2 ( Reduction to RMQ) Longest Common Extension / LCE | Set 3 (Segment Tree Method) Trie : Trie | (Insert and Search) Trie | (Delete) Longest prefix matching – A Trie based solution in Java Pattern Searching using a Trie of all Suffixes Find shortest unique prefix for every word in a given list Longest Common Prefix Print all words matching a pattern in CamelCase Notation Dictonary Implement a Phone Directory Construct a unique matrix n x n for an input n Print unique rows in a given boolean matrix Count of distinct substrings of a string using Suffix Trie Find pair of rows in a binary matrix that has maximum bit difference Minimum XOR Value Pair Find the maximum subarray XOR in a given array Weighted Prefix Search Boggle Print all valid words that are possible using Characters of Array Find the k most frequent words from a file Palindrome pair in an array of words (or strings) Word formation using concatenation of two dictionary words Given a sequence of words, print all anagrams together How to Implement Reverse DNS Look Up Cache?
