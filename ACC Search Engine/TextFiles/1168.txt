This is probably the first and most common interview question for teachers. The school administrators' interview panel wants to know that you are motivated enough to work through inevitable frustrations. The school administration wants to know completely about you as an individual and as an educator by asking this question. You have to make it clear here what you can bring to the school. While answering this question, you can say that I always wanted to be a teacher because I want to help people, but this is a very common answer, and it won't be effective. You should find something specific that shows you are motivated like no other. A Sample Example: In my school days, I was a very shy, introvert, and weak student. I have some problems reading long sentences. One of my teachers introduced me to an amazing list of short stories and books. Her style of teaching was unique and playful. She read to us and worked with us on reading comprehension. Her care switched on an unquenchable thirst that led me to read thousands of books on topics as diverse as history, biology, sociology, and nature. That teachers' attention forever changed my thinking towards society. Since then, I have always wanted to do exactly what she did to us. That's why I wanted to be a teacher. 2) What is your teaching style or philosophy? /What adjectives would you use to describe your presence in the classroom? By asking this question, the interviewers want to check that are you a good fit for their school? The school administration wants to know that you are not just trying to push students toward some goal or academic result but want to help them develop inside and outside school. Here, you have to clear that you care about people and their success, not just your professional achievements. A Sample Answer: I believe in teaching each student's passion. I give attention to every student and try to enhance their passion by delivering structured lessons. Sample Answer Two: You can say that I am strict, but it is fair when teaching. When students are challenged with realistic goals and given the support, they need not just get the answers right but also use those learning to solve future problems on their own. As a teacher, I believe that it is my job to support my students through their lessons. I also have to stay strong with my students with various challenges they may face at school. I have to partner with them and other support systems to help them feel motivated, comfortable, and happy in the classroom. 3) How much do you want to know about your students to be most helpful to them? The school's administrator wants to know every detail about their teaching staff, so they try to know your views about this. Indeed, a doctor doesn't need to know her patient's favorite ice cream flavor, but you have to answer this question in your interview in the following way: A Sample Answer: First, I try to know the student's learning styles, passions, and challenges and then try to get involved with them. For example, in my previous school, there was a child who was disruptive in class. I joined him on the playground on and off. I found out he was being bullied after school by his brother's friends. I spoke with his parents, and they had no idea. After that, he became a good student, and as a result, my whole class got quieter and easier to teach. 4) Why do you want to work for our school? By asking this question, the school administrators want to know if you want this job. So, you have to say about the things you love about the school. Before the interview, prepare yourself by talking to teachers who work there, check out the school's website, mission statement, and about us page. A Sample Answer: I have huge respect for the ABC School's teaching method to their students. This school's focus on academics, character, community, and nature perfectly fits my philosophy. So, I find it easier to teach these well-groomed students. 5) What is the best way to prepare for a teaching interview? We must follow the steps given below to prepare for a teaching interview: Do Detailed Research: The first thing is to research the school online and talk to teachers. Learn their challenges. Practice makes a man perfect: It is time to practice the sample teacher interview questions. The more you practice, the easy it will become the interview. Make a plan: Now, you have to gather materials like a lesson plan, Praxis scores, and transcripts. You should also include images as proof of your accomplishments. 6) How can you help our school or students? / How would you be beneficial for our school? The school administrators ask this interview question to check if you have a plan for their students or not. Before going for an interview, the candidate must do proper research about the school. He/she must be aware of the school history and the students. Just take your time to learn the school's needs first. Suppose you are going for an interview at a school where a high percentage of are disruptive students. Here, the following should be an excellent possible answer: A Sample Answer: Sir, I have interacted with several of your teachers and heard about their classroom management challenges. My classroom management skills are highly developed. I have taken 18 continuing education credits in class management from the online program of a reputed university. I was commended at my last school after fully engaging a class with over 20% disruptive students. 7) What is your strategy to motivate students? The interview panel wants to see how you influence students to do what you want them to do. This question is asked to see how you can make your students motivated to study more. A Sample Answer: Sir, We need positive reinforcement to keep a student motivated. So one thing I would like to give rewards or bonuses when they perform incredibly well. I never want students to feel left out or overindulged, so I always try to be fair and consistent with everyone. 8) What is the most frustrating thing for you about teaching? The interviewer asks this question to see if you are easily discouraged. This is also an excellent question to check the inner strength of the candidate. You must be very careful while answering this question. A Sample Answer: Respected Sir, teaching is my passion, and I always love to teach students. Sometimes, I get very frustrated with bright kids who become overconfident and lose focus from the study. It will really become a worrying and sad situation if a genuine potential is wasted. In my last school, I worked with several children who weren't trying. I implemented a research-based program to incorporate student ideas into the lesson plan. Their thoughts created complete engagement, and the test scores went up 15% in just two months. 9) How would you get your classroom ready for the first day of school? The interview panel asks this question to check how to prepare you are to take your class. You should be very careful while answering this question because the first steps create a first impression. Your plan for the first steps says a lot about your teaching skills. A Sample Answer: Sir, I want my classroom to be welcoming and cooperative. I want to make some rules for everyone. It is good to put a welcome sign and labeled desks to help students. Engaging posters and other visual aids help create a sense of excitement. Beyond fun, an extensive list of rules and consequences at the front of the room allows the class to start on the right foot. 10) Why do we teach science and Mathematics only in school? The interviewer asks this question to know why your subjects matter to you. It is important to stand with your positive points and try to convince your interviewer why you are the best option for these subjects. You can say that Science and Math are fundamental subjects for the future of the students. A Sample Answer: I believe that our future depends on science as people use science in day-to-day decisions. Science can make us wonder about our natural world. Science and Mathematics can improve the learning skills of the students. 11) What makes you the best choice for this school? The interview panel asks this question to check how well you have researched about the school. While answering this question, be confident and try to demonstrate your knowledge and skills. Explain that you have complete information which this school requires. A firm answer could include information about recent test scores, specific programs, or awards earned by the school. A Sample Answer: I am fascinated and inspired by this school's reputation for educational excellence and encouraging creativity through its renowned arts program. I have found that there is a dip in the AP test scores in recent years, so I am incredibly excited to introduce my teaching strategies. I feel confident that I could help students improve their scores and opportunities for success. 12) What characteristics do students want in their teachers? Every teacher has a unique teaching style; similarly, every student enjoys different teaching styles. So, it becomes imperative that a teacher be adaptable. Here, you have to explain what characteristics you think are most important for a teacher to possess, how these characteristics would be beneficial for the students, and how you would develop those qualities in yourself. A Sample Answer: Dear Sir, I believe that students want a dedicated and approachable teacher who will be available when a student needs him/her. If the students know you are working hard and want to support them as they learn, the chances of their success increases. That's why I follow an open approach at all times and try to make a friendly bond with each student. 13) If you find a student in your class has a severe behavior problem, how will you manage it? This is a very serious question because most probably you can face this type of case. Here, you have to convince the interviewer how you would solve the disciplinary issues in your school. A Sample Answer: Sir, I believe that in most cases, misbehavior is nothing more than a call for help, and underneath that behavior, issues is a serious problem that should be recognized and addressed. To deal with this, I would talk to the child separately and see if there is an issue. According to my experience, I find that some kids create disruptions only to seek attention. I would ensure that if we provide their fair share of attention to such kids, they will never create any problem. 14) Do you believe that a teacher's personality affects their success? How? A teacher's personality indeed affects their success. The interviewer asks this question to inspire you to express your vision of success and the tools needed to achieve it. While answering this question, you have to describe some of the personal qualities that teachers need to succeed and some of the obstacles to success they must overcome. A Sample Answer: Sir, I believe that teachers need to have flexibility, compassion, self-discipline, drive, and patience to reach their students. Teachers should also be able to change their styles according to their students that they can learn effectively. Teachers should make test papers according to their lesson plans and make sure that they understand the materials they'll be tested. 15) How do you encourage parents/guardians to incorporate themselves into students' education? The interviewer asks this question to determine how you would facilitate relationships with students' parents. The involvement of parents in their child's education is crucial for their success. Teachers must communicate with parents clearly and effectively to encourage them to involve them in their studies. While answering this question, you should emphasize the parent's role in their child's education and explain how you plan to include parents. A Sample Answer: Respected Sir, I believe that a child's education depends on the support of his or her parents. I think that engaging with parents and making sure that they have an active role in their child's success is vital. I cooperate with the child's parents and give my contact information to them to get in touch and ask any questions about their child's performance. I also provide updates periodically about what my students have learned and accomplished. 16) How would you integrate the use of technology in your classroom? In the modern world, the use of technology is inevitable. A teacher must have to use technology to make the lessons clear and easily understandable for his/her students. While answering this question, you can either narrate the popular & latest technologies in education or share a real-life situation where you successfully used technology in the classroom. A Sample Answer: In the modern era of technology, we can make lessons more fun & interesting with technology. With internet access in the classroom, students can study every topic in detail for any subject. By using technologies like smartboards and PowerPoint presentations, we can make lessons more effective. However, teachers must be aware of the internet's negative influences and protect the students from that influence. Sample Answer Two: Respected Sir, in my previous school, I have used technology very effectively in my classroom. For example, when I was teaching "India's freedom struggle," I showed my students a documentary film on Youtube. This gave them a deeper understanding of the struggle and interestingly learned important names and dates. 17) What is the best way to drive enthusiasm and participation amongst students? A student must be full of enthusiasm and participate in multiple activities to groom his/her personality and create an immutable characteristic. You must be very careful while answering this question. Let's see some sample answers: A Sample Answer: In my opinion, the best way to drive participation and enthusiasm among students is to create a sense of parity/equality in the classroom. We should provide equal opportunity to bright as well as underperforming students. By doing this, we can help each student deal with their fear of failure, and in the long run, they will be able to build their confidence and self-esteem. Sample Answer two: Sir, I have a good plan for students I have applied and tested in my previous school. I prepare my lessons creatively and use many learning aids like quizzes, role plays, documentaries, etc. By using this, we can keep the students deeply involved in the learning process. I also support students for their creativity in my classroom and often reward them with unique ideas. 18) What is your strategy to deal with angry parents? The school's interview panel asks this question to the candidate because it is a very common situation a teacher can face in the school. This question is asked to check the temperament of the teacher. The best possible answer would be as follow: A Sample Answer: It is obvious for parents to be sensitive when it comes to their children. Sometimes, they lose their temper and are rude to their children's teachers. To deal with this situation, I first listen patiently to what the parents have to say and then talk to them diplomatically and logically. 19) How would your past students, your colleagues, and school administrators describe you? The interviewer asks this question to check your personality and self-awareness. It also describes how impressive you are in your school and between your students. The school administration may compare your answer to how your references described you. While answering this question, you should show strong interpersonal skills and perceptiveness. You can share any incident from your experience to support your answer. A Sample Answer: I think my colleagues and students would describe me as an encouraging, creative and inspiring individual. In my previous school, I love planning fun activities for my classroom and involving other classrooms. For example, last year, I organized "Pi day" on March 14th (3/14) for my class. I planned scavenger hunts, relay races, and trivia, all based on math. It was great to see all the students work together, have fun and learn. 20) How do you evaluate students of your class? It is a very important question because you can be judged on your answer. So, be careful while answering this question. Following are the best possible answers: A Sample Answer: I think a student must be evaluated on many aspects. The evaluation should show the holistic development of students.
