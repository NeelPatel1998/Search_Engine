They are completely free to use: Browse Themes Browse Basic Templates Bootstrap 3 vs. Bootstrap 4 Bootstrap 4 is the newest version of Bootstrap; with new components, faster stylesheet and more responsiveness. Bootstrap 4 supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 9 and down is not supported. If you require IE8-9 support, use Bootstrap 3. It is the most stable version of Bootstrap, and it is still supported by the team for critical bugfixes and documentation changes. However, no new features will be added to it. Go To Bootstrap 4 » Did You Know? W3.CSS is an excellent alternative to Bootstrap. W3.CSS is smaller, faster, and easier to use. If you want to learn W3.CSS, go to our W3.CSS Tutorial. ? Home Next ?
