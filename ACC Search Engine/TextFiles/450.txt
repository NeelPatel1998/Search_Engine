The Executor API reduces the execution of the task from the actual task to be executed through the Executors. The executor framework is an implementation of the Producer-Consumer pattern. The java.util.concurrent.Executors class provides a set of methods for creating ThreadPools of worker threads. In order to use the executor framework, we have to create a thread pool for executing the task by submitting that task to that thread pool. Now, the question which comes to our mind is why we have to create such thread pools when we already have the java.lang.Thread class for creating an object and Runnable/Callable interface for achieving parallelism by implementing them. So, the reason for creating such thread pools are as follows: We need to create a large number of threads for adding a new thread without any throttling for each and every process. Due to which it requires more memory and cause wastage of resource. When each thread is swapped, the CPU starts to spend too much time. When we create a new thread for executing a new task cause overhead of thread creation. In order to manage this thread life-cycle, the execution time increase respectively. Types of Executors In Java, there are different types of executors available which are as follows: 1) SingleThreadExecutor The SingleThreadExecutor is a special type of executor that has only a single thread. It is used when we need to execute tasks in sequential order. In case when a thread dies due to some error or exception at the time of executing a task, a new thread is created, and all the subsequent tasks execute in that new one. 
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
 2) FixedThreadPool(n) FixedThreadPool is another special type of executor that is a thread pool having a fixed number of threads. By this executor, the submitted task is executed by the n thread. In case when we need to execute more tasks after submitting previous tasks, they store in the LinkedBlockingQueue until previous tasks are not completed. The n denotes the total number of thread which are supported by the underlying processor. 
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
 3) CachedThreadPool The CachedThreadPool is a special type of thread pool that is used to execute short-lived parallel tasks. The cached thread pool doesn't have a fixed number of threads. When a new task comes at a time when all the threads are busy in executing some other tasks, a new thread creates by the pool and add to the executor. When a thread becomes free, it carries out the execution of the new tasks. Threads are terminated and removed from the cached when they remain idle for sixty seconds. 
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
 4) ScheduledExecutor The ScheduledExecutor is another special type of executor which we use to run a certain task at regular intervals. It is also used when we need to delay a certain task. 
ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecService = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
 The scheduleAtFixedRate and scheduleWithFixedDelay are the two methods that are used to schedule the task in ScheduledExecutor. The scheduleAtFixedRate method executes the task with a fixed interval when the previous task ended. The scheduleWithFixedDelay method starts the delay count after the current task complete. The main difference between these two methods is their interpretation of the delay between successive executions of a scheduled job. Both the methods are used in the following way: 
scheduledExecService.scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit)
 
scheduledExecService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit)
 Let's take an example to understand how executors are actually used to execute a task. We will simply create a task and try to execute it by the simple executor and ThreadPoolExecutor one by one. Task1.java 
//creating Task1 class that implements the Runnable interface
public class Task1 implements Runnable {
	
	//initialize threadNo variable 
    private String threadNo;
    
	//using constructor to set value to the threadNo variable
    public Task1(String no){
        this.threadNo = no;
    }
	
	//using run() method by overriding it
    @Override
    public void run() {
		//printing thread information 
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" start execution. Thread No = "+threadNo);
		
		//calling processThread() method for processing thread
        processThread();
		
		//printing a statement to show the end of the thread
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" stop execution.");
    }
	
	//creating processThread() method to execute thread
    private void processThread() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
	
	//overriding toString() method 
    @Override
    public String toString(){
        return this.threadNo;
    }
}
 SimpleExecutor.java 
//importing classes 
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

//creating SimpleExecutor class
public class SimpleExecutor {
	//main() method start
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //creating an object of ExecutorService with fixed thread pool 5
		ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            //creating instance of the Task1 class and pass a value to its constructor 
			Runnable task = new Task1("" + j);
			
			//executing task using execute() method of the executor
            executorService.execute(task);
          }
		//closing executor
        executorService.shutdown();
        
		while (!executorService.isTerminated()) {
        }
		System.out.println("Finished all threads");
    }
}
 Output: Let's take an example of ThreadPoolExecutor to understand how it is different from the SimpleExecutor. RejectedExecutionHandlerDemo.java The RejectedExecutionHandlerDemo class is used for handling the jobs that are rejected from the worker queue. When the limit of the thread pool size reach, RejectedExecutionHandler handles those jobs that cannot fit in the worker thread. We will implement the RejectedExecutionHandler.java class in the following way: 
//importing RejectedExecutionHandler, and ThreadPoolExecutor classes 
import java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor;

//creating RejectedExecutionHandlerDemo class to handle rejected execution
public class RejectedExecutionHandlerDemo implements RejectedExecutionHandler {

    //defining abstract method of RejectedExecutionHandler class
	@Override
    public void rejectedExecution(Runnable runnableObject, ThreadPoolExecutor executorObjet) {
        //printing the rejected thread
		System.out.println(runnableObject.toString() + " is rejected");
    }

}
 NewTask.java We create the NewTask.java class to create a thread that monitors the executor and prints its information at a certain time interval. There are several methods available in the ThreadPoolExecutor class that is used to get the current state of the executor, number of active threads, number of tasks, and pool size. We create the monitor thread in the following way: 
//importing ThreadPoolExecutor class
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor;

//creating NewTask class that implements the Runnable interface
public class NewTask implements Runnable
{
    private ThreadPoolExecutor exe;//creating a private variable of type ThreadPoolExecutor
    private int delay; //creating a private variable of type integer for delay
    private boolean run = true; //creating a private boolean variable to determine whether 
	
	//using constructor to set the value to the exe and delay variable
    public NewTask(ThreadPoolExecutor exe, int delay)
    {
		this.exe = exe;
        this.delay = delay;
    }
	
	//creating shutdown() method to update the value of the boolean variable run 
    public void shutdown(){
        this.run = false;
    }
	
	//overriding the run() method of the Runnable interface
    @Override
    public void run()
    {
		//running task
        while(run){
                System.out.println(
                    String.format("[monitor [%d/%d] Number of active threads = %d, Number of completed tasks = %d, Number of tasks = %d, Shutdown = %s, Terminated = %s",
                        this.exe.getPoolSize(),
                        this.exe.getCorePoolSize(),
                        this.exe.getActiveCount(),
                        this.exe.getCompletedTaskCount(),
                        this.exe.getTaskCount(),
                        this.exe.isShutdown(),
                        this.exe.isTerminated()));
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(this.delay*1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
        }
            
    }
}
 ThreadPoolExecutorExample.java It is used to create the thread pool using the ThreadPoolExecutor. 
//importing classes required for implementing ThreadPoolExecutor
import java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

//creating ThreadPoolExecutorExample to execute task
public class ThreadPoolExecutorExample {
	
	//main method start
    public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException{
        
		//creating an instance of the RejectedExecutionHandlerExample class
        RejectedExecutionHandlerDemo rejectionHandlerObj = new RejectedExecutionHandlerDemo();
        
		//creating an instance of the ThreadFactory class
        ThreadFactory t1 = Executors.defaultThreadFactory();
        
		//creating an instance of the ThreadPoolExecutor class
        ThreadPoolExecutor exePool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(2, 4, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<Runnable>(2), t1, rejectionHandlerObj);
        
		//starting the NewTask thread
		NewTask task = new NewTask(exePool, 3);
        Thread th = new Thread(task);
        th.start();
        //submit job to the pool
        for(int j=0; j<10; j++){
            exePool.execute(new Task1("cmd"+j));
        }
        
        Thread.sleep(30000);
        //shutting down the job pool
        exePool.shutdown();
		
        //shutting down the th thread
        Thread.sleep(5000);
        task.shutdown();
        
    }
}
 Output: Notice the change in the number of active threads, the number of the completed task, and the number of tasks. The shutdown() method is used to finish the execution of all the submitted tasks and terminate the thread pool. Next TopicGregorian calendar Java ? prev next ?
