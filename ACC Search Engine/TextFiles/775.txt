Or it also needs to share your current location or active location with those who are continuing. In such a situation, an active location tracker can become helpful for you. In this article, we will share some information that lets you know how to share location on Android or other devices. One of the exciting things about location sharing is that you are the only person who gives others to access and track your location. Also, you can cancel any time to get track from your location. There are many active location sharing and tracking apps/tools you will found over the Internet (Google Play Store). Share Location on Android using Google Maps: Google Maps provide an option to share your Android device's location to your contacts list. Using its location sharing feature, people can quickly meet together even at an unfamiliar place. Google Maps facilitate sharing location to other contacts who have Google account and people who have not. You can also set the time duration to keep active your share location on another device. There are two different ways to share location to Android: the first method to share location to those who have Google account, and another method to share location to those contacts that don't have Google account. Sharing Location using Google Maps to contacts having Google account Open the Google Maps app on your Android smartphone. If you don't previously login, then login with your Google account. Click on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) present at the top-left of the screen to access menu options. Now, click on the Location sharing. It will pop-up a screen showing information "Let friends know where you are" and allows sharing your real-time location with friends & family. Look for the GET STARTED option and click on it. Now, set the time for which you want to share your location. There are the options to choose for 1 hour, customize time by clicking the + and - button or set time "Until you turn this off." After setting the time, select the contact whom you wish to share your location and click on Share Now, your contact person with whom you share your location will open their Google Map app and see your location on the map. On the other side, the person opposite to you can also share their location with you from the same screen by enabling the toggle button "Share your location." If you wish to stop sharing your location, go to the Location sharing screen again and click on the X (stop icon) icon appears on the side of person you shared location. Once you stop sharing your location, a notification will send to the person whom you shared your location as "<your name> isn't sharing with you." Sharing location using Google Maps to contacts doesn't have Google account: If you want to share your Android phone's location with contacts that do not have a Google Account, their contact icon will not show the Google Maps icon attached with them. You can share location to such contacts with the help of links using the Google Map app. To share your location with such contacts follow the below steps.

A pop-up screen appears that shows the location will be shared via the link. Accept it by clicking OK and tap on Share. These steps may be varies based on the Android phone model and its version. Google Maps share a link to your default text message app to send it to your selected person(s). Now, share the location link via your text messaging app. You can also share the location link using email, copy the location link, paste it to email, WhatsApp, etc. and send it to your contact(s). When your contact person(s) open the link, they will navigate to Google Maps and see your location. If you wish to stop sharing your location, go to the Location sharing screen again and click on the X (stop icon) icon appears on the side of person you shared location.
