It is a very useful property of CSS. We can apply it to various tags. It is a part of the CSS display property. Usage: 
display: inline-block
 By applying the above property, the element will behave as inline and block for its child elements. Let's understand the inline and block elements. Inline Elements The elements that do not begin on a new line are known as inline elements. They are combined as a part of the main text and not a separate action. These elements occupy only the required space. Spaces to the left and right can be added to an inline element, but there cannot be added height to the top or bottom padding or margin of an inline element. Example of Inline elements: <span>, <a>, <code>, <strong>, <img>, <cite>, <button>, <input>, <textarea>, <select>, <small> are some of the inline tags. Example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
<style>
.highlight{
background-color:#efefef}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div>It is a demo span <span class="highlight">inline element</span>;
whose span is an highlighted with a grey color indicating that it is an inline tag</div>
</body>
</html>
 Output: Block Elements The elements that begin on a new line are known as block elements. A block element acquires up the full width available for that content. Unlike inline, there exists a top and bottom margin for these elements. Block-level elements may only appear inside the body tag. Block-level elements create a larger structure than inline elements. Example of block elements: <div>, <p>, <li>, <main>, <nav>, <ul>, <form>, <video>, <table>, <aside>, <article> are some of the inline tags. Example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
<style>
p { background-color: #8A55; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>This paragraph is a block-level element; its background has been colored to display the paragraph's parent element.</p>
</body>
</html>
 Output: Inline Block Elements The display value of inline-block works similarly to inline with one exception: the height and width of that element become modifiable. Example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
span.b {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 5px;
  color:white;
  border: 1px solid blue;    
  background-color: blue; 
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div>This is an example of inline-block element with a span colored as blue <span class="b">Inline-Block</span>  </div>
</body>
</html>
 Output: Below is the output file using all the elements on one page: Code 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
span.a {
  display: inline; /* the default for span */
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid white;  
  background-color: blue; 
}
span.b {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid white;    
  background-color: green; 
}
span.c {
  display: block;
  width: 70px;
  height: 50px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid blue;    
  background-color: pink; 
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
