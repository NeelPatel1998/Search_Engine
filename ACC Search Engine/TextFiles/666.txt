Geek of the month – March 2021 Testimonial: ” It is really a great honor being the geek of the month. In my college days, I spend a lot of time in Gfg. Starting from the Gfg campus ambassador program to the technical content writing it is really a memorable experience for me. Gfg is not only a website now it is a brand for the computer science enthusiast. It has all the updated things you need to excel in your studies and career. Gfg is the only reason to fall in love with data structure and programming. Especially the content of the DSA course of Sandeep Jain sir is literally priceless. I wish I know about that course and Gfg in my first semester. Not only coding but Gfg also had excellent articles on all the core computer science subjects. So starting from my semester exam to my placement preparation Gfg always holds me back. During my technical content writing journey, I learned a lot of things meet many new awesome peoples, among them I want to thank Anshul sir for helping and clearing my doubts whenever I need. So geeks stay motivated, learn a lot from Gfg and share their knowledge and help other geeks by writing articles. Thank You. Certificate : Pinaki Banerjee, Published Articles Geek of the month – February 2021 Testimonial: “Don’t give up easily. Try again and again, definitely you will reach destiny” GFG is a brand and much bigger than that. Learned a lot of technical skills while working for GFG. I Started Technical Content writing in the second semester on GFG platform and faced so many rejections, almost 100 articles rejected by GFG Engineers. Finally, hard work pays off and got a Technical content writer intern and after some months got another intern as the technical content reviewer of my domain. My advice to new contributors: •Don’t write articles only for the sake of intern and stipend. •While writing articles think that you are a teacher and the reader is your student try to explain everything that you know about the article. •Don’t try to copy anything from any other website for the content of your article. At last, I would like to thanks again Sandeep Jain sir for providing us such an amazing platform Happy Coding. .

To be good in this you must have the vision to judge other’s code also i.e. solving issues or removing errors by understanding other’s code is the key point to check yourself. While going through over other user’s code, you will get to know the more tricks and techniques to solve a problem which will help in enhancing your knowledge and you will also get to learn some good writing skills. “Learn while you write or Write while you learn” is the best thing which GFG is providing to us and also what I like the most. So, Keep Learning and Keep Writing. Happy Coding ? Thanks GFG ? Certificate : Sahil Chhabra , Published Articles Geek of the month – November 2017 Testimonial : As a GFG content writer and final-year student, I had visualized that GFG helps students for both the perspective that reinforces concepts and knowledge, or to prepare for their future placement opportunities. Starting as a beginner, I had explored myself about a wide range of concepts related to DS and algorithm from GFG, which provided me with many different effective problem-solving techniques. In addition to the subjective knowledge and placement preparation, regular training at GFG will certainly improve your approach to competitive programming. The best of GFG that has made a huge impact on me are daily updated articles on the homepage that offer a random but effective level of knowledge for students. Fly for your dream but make GFG your jet ?? ?
