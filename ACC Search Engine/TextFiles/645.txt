Puppet Tutorial Puppet is an open-source DevOps system management tool. It is used to centralize and automate the configuration management procedure. This tool is developed using Ruby DSL (domain-specific language). Puppet tool deploys, configures, and manages the servers. This tutorial will help in understanding why Puppet is so popular and what makes it unique when compared to other configuration management tools. All the examples in this tutorial are tested. This code can be used with any puppet configuration by changing the current defined names and variables. What is Puppet? Puppet is a DevOps configuration management tool. This is developed by Puppet Labs and is available for both open-source and enterprise versions. It is used to centralize and automate the procedure of configuration management. This tool is developed using Ruby DSL (domain-specific language), which allows you to change a complete infrastructure in code format and can be easily managed and configured. Puppet tool deploys, configures, and manages the servers. This is used particularly for the automation of hybrid infrastructure delivery and management. With the help of automation, Puppet enables system administrators to operate easier and faster. Puppet can also be used as a deployment tool as it can deploy software on the system automatically. Puppet implements infrastructure as a code, which means that you can test the environment for accurate deployment. uppet supports many platforms such as Microsoft Windows, Debian/Ubuntu, Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora, MacOS X, etc. Puppet uses the client-server paradigm, where one system in any cluster works as the server, called the puppet master, and other works as a client on nodes called a slave. Features of Puppet Following are the features of Puppet: Platform Support Puppet is compatible with all platforms that support Ruby, like Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS X, etc. Scalable The puppet was developed in 2005; therefore, many different organizations, including medium and large, have deployed Puppet, and hence its scalability is very large. Documentation Puppet provides a large number of well-developed wiki pages with detailed documentation. Idempotency Unlike other configuration management tools, in Puppet, we can safely run the same set of configurations multiple times on the same machine. Means, after deploying a configuration on any machine, the puppet keeps verifying those configurations in certain intervals. Open-Source A puppet is an open-source tool, and because of this feature, it is easy to extend it to build custom libraries and modules. Reporting Compliance The enterprise version of the puppet supports graphical reporting with the help of this you can simply visualize the infrastructure, communicate, and quickly respond to the modifications. It provides you the real-time visibility into the effects of changes, which allows you to see what's going on your infrastructure. Cost-Effective When you have many numbers of systems and want to make some minor code changes, then Puppet helps to reduce the effort and cost. Faster Puppet allows DevOps professionals and System Administrators to work more quickly and effectively. Growing Fast Today, many companies have adopted puppet to manage their infrastructure, such as Google, Red Hat, AT&T, Spotify, AON, US Air Force, etc. Prerequisites Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic knowledge of system administration, network protocol communication, and infrastructure. To automate the infrastructure provisioning, we should have a basic understanding of Ruby scripts and the system where we want to use Puppet.
