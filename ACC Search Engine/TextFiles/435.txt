Lots of people are asking about how to hack Wi-Fi passwords using Android and whether it is possible or not. The straightforward answer is "yes" you can hack Wi-Fi passwords in Android devices using some tricks and tools (apps). Before diving into our main topic about how to hack Wi-Fi passwords in Android phones, we first discuss some of the basic information about the type of Wi-Fi password security. Types of Wi-Fi Password Security There are primarily three different types of Wi-Fi password securities. These Wi-Fi securities are as follows: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) Wi-Fi security is one of the most popular and widely used Wi-Fi securities in the entire world. However, this security is a most week and insecure as well. Someone can easily crack and hack such Wi-Fi security using Airmon tools from Kali Linux and Aircrack. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) Wi-Fi security is the improved and updated version of WEP Wi-Fi security system. This Wi-Fi security system was introduced in the year 2003. But an American hacker found a significant flaw in WPA security keys. Due to which it became easy to hack this Wi-Fi security. It is possible to crack any Wi-Fi password that has WPA security from an Android smartphone. Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) Finally, the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is only the Wi-Fi security system that is not easy to hack and crack. However, in some cases, it is also found that this Wi-Fi security also gets hacked but requires high hacking skills. If someone uses WPS security, then it might be difficult to hack this security. Method 1: Hacking Wi-Fi Password in Android using WIFI WPS WPA TESTER (without Rooting) Wi-Fi WPS WPA TESTER is a popular Android app which is widely used for hacking Wi-Fi passwords. Wi-Fi WPS TESTER app hacks only those routers that connect with WPS router with limited features. Hacking Wi-Fi using this app is so easy and only requires follows few steps. The best part of this application is that you can use it without rooting your Android phone. You can also use this app on a rooted Android phone with some extra features. Using this Android app, you can easily check the wireless security and strength of your router. If the router is not secure, then the WIFI WPS WPA TESTER app easily bypasses Wi-Fi password on your Android phone. After skipping the password, it connects the Android phone with the router without providing a password. The Wi-Fi WPS WPA TESTER hacking apps work on both rooted and non rooted Android phones. Below are the steps to hack Wi-Fi password on Android without rooting. Download and install the WIFI WPS WPA TESTER app from Play Store. Enable the Wi-Fi settings on your Android phone. Launch the app and search for the Wi-Fi networks nearby you. Select one of the networks from the result and start hacking by tap. You can input its key manually. The app checks the Wi-Fi security, and it tries different combinations of words and numbers to crack the Wi-Fi password. The app finds the network code in a short time and connects your phone automatically. Method 2: Hacking Wi-Fi password in Android using AndroDumper App APK (without Rooting) AndroDumper is another popular app used for hacking Wi-Fi passwords in Android phones.

If the selected network has a weak Wi-Fi password, then this app possibly hacks it. Method 3: Hacking Wi-Fi password in Android having WPA2 WPS Router (Root device) In this method of hacking Wi-Fi passwords in Android, we will use the Bcmon and Reaver Android app. At first, you need a root Android phone if you don't have tried to root your device. Ensure that your root Android phone contains Broadcom bcm4329 or bcm4330 chipsets as present in Samsung Galaxy S1/S2, HTC Desire HD, Nexus 7, Nexus 1, etc. Download and install the BCmon app APK file on your Android phone.

Tap on the APN or access point you want to crack and continue Wi-Fi password. Sometimes you need to verify your monitor mode to continue, and you can do this by reopening the BCmon app again. Go to settings in the Reaver app and checked to mark "Automatic Advanced setting" box. Finally, start your Wi-Fi cracking process by clicking on the start attack; in this last step, cracking the WPS Wi-Fi security may take 2-10 hours to succeed. Method 4: Hacking Wi-Fi password in Android using Wi-Fi WPS Connect app (Root device) Using the Wi-Fi WPS Connect app you can hack Wi-Fi password on Android. The app works on both rooted and non-rooted (Lollipop and above) phones. However, it is mainly preferred for the rooted device because of the database information. If you found any Wi-Fi connection on your Android device having WPS security, you can easily connect with it without providing any password. The WPS Connect app bypasses WPS Wi-Fi security and connects with Wi-Fi without entering any password. Below are the steps to hack Wi-Fi password and connect your Android phone using this app: Download and install the Wi-Fi WPS Connect app on your Android phone. Enable the Wi-Fi settings of your phone. Launch the WPS Connect app and tap on the scan button to scan all nearby Wi-Fi networks. It takes few times to display all nearby Wi-Fi networks, including their details (such as password security types, network types, signal strength, etc.). Choose a Wi-Fi network and tap on it you wish to hack. A pop-up screen appears with a pre-defined list of keys (PIN). Tap on the key to start your hacking process. The app tries several times to hack Wi-Fi with default keys and the most widely used Wi-Fi keys. Wait for few minutes, and the Wi-Fi password will be hacked successfully. Method 5: Hacking Wi-Fi password in Android using WPSAPP WPSAPP is an all-in-one app that allows you to connect nearby Wi-Fi networks using an 8-digit PIN. The WPSAPP app makes easier and convenient to hack Wi-Fi password in both rooted and non-rooted Android phones. It applies several algorithms for generating random pins as well as some default pins. Using this app, you can hack any WEP Wi-Fi network without any difficulties. When you scan for the networks, they appear with the red cross, question marks, and green tick marks. The red cross networks are secure, and their password is unknown. The networks showing with question marks have WPS protocol enabled, their pin is unknown, and the app allows testing them with a most common pin. Finally, the green ticks networks are WPS protocol enabled and their password known, and they can be connected.
