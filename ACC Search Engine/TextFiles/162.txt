In the horizontal direction, only With depth only Neither with depth nor along the horizontal direction Both with depth and along the horizontal direction Show Answer Workspace Answer: B [With depth only] Description: According to Pascal's law, a fluid's local pressure is the same in all directions. Hence, the pressure won't vary along the x and y-direction. The local pressure will increase with an increase in depth due to the water column's extra weight above that point. 6) Which of the following cannot be the value of a fluid's absolute pressure at any point? 1.013 bar 0 200 bar - 1 bar Show Answer Workspace Answer: D [ - 1 bar ] Description: Absolute zero pressure is the reference used for the measurement of absolute pressure.

Buoyant force decreases Buoyant force increases Buoyant force first increases then show a decrease Buoyant force remains constant Show Answer Workspace Answer: A [ Buoyant force decreases ] Description: Buoyant force acting on the airship decreases as it rises in the air as air at higher altitudes becomes rarer, and its density decreases. 11) A uniform body of size 4 m long * 2.5 m wide * 1.5 m deep floats in water. What is the weight of the body if the depth of immersion is 1 m? 294.3 kN 147.1 kN 588.6 kN 73.5 kN Show Answer Workspace Answer: B [ 147.1 kN ] Description: Weight of Body = Weight of water displaced = ? * g * Volume of displaced water = 9.81 * 1000 * 4 * 2.5 * 1.5 = 147.1kN. 12) A block of material of specific gravity 0.45 floats in water. Determine the block's meta-centric height if its size is 3 m * 2 m* 0.8 m. 0.376 m 0.506 m 0.127 m 1.012 m Show Answer Workspace Answer: A [ 0.376 m ] Description: BG = Centre of pontoon - Centre of immersed portion = 0.4 - 0.55*0.8 = 0.04 Metacentric height = I/? - BG I = bd³/12 = 3*2³/12 ? = 3*2*0.8 Metacentric height = 0.376 m. 13) A solid cylinder of diameter 5.0 m has a height of 6.0 m.

Eulerian method Lagrangian method Neither Lagrangian nor Eulerian method Both Lagrangian and Eulerian methods Show Answer Workspace Answer: A [ Eulerian way] Description: In Fluid Mechanics, the matter of concern is the general state of motion at various points in the fluid system (as in the Eulerian approach) rather than each particle's motion (as in the Lagrangian approach). Hence, the Eulerian method is extensively used in Fluid Mechanics. 16) What type of flow can be taken for granted in a pipe of a uniform cross-section? Unsteady Steady Non-Uniform Uniform Show Answer Workspace Answer: D [ uniform ] Description: According to the continuity equation, ?AV =constant, where ?= density, A= cross-sectional area of flow, V = velocity of flow. For a uniform cross-section pipe, no matter the flow rate, the velocity of flow inside the pipe will always remain constant. Hence, it'll always be a uniform flow. It'll be a steady flow if and only if the water level is maintained at a constant level by supplying water at the same rate as it gets discharged. Else the water level will keep decreasing with time leading to an unsteady flow. 17) "The velocity of entrance and exit through a nozzle remains the same." Is this even possible? only if the flow is laminar only if the flow is compressible never possible only if the flow is rotational Show Answer Workspace Answer: B [ only if the flow is compressible ] Description: According to the continuity equation, ?AV =constant, where ?= density, A= cross-sectional area of flow, V = velocity of flow. If v =constant, ?A =constant. Thus a change in A will mean a change in ?. Hence, the flow is possible only if the fluid is compressible. 18) What will be the shape of the pathline for a one-dimensional flow be like? Parabolic Straight line Elliptical Hyperbolic Show Answer Workspace Answer: B [ Straight line ] Description: A pathline is a path followed by a particle in motion. For a one-dimensional flow, the fluids move in only one dimension (say x). Hence the pathline will also be a straight line (along that direction). 19) What is the maximum number of times the two particles' pathlines can intersect in a one-dimensional flow? 1 0 Infinite 2 Show Answer Workspace Answer: A [ 1 ] Description: The pathline of a particle in a one-dimensional flow is a straight line along the direction it moves. When two particles move in the same direction, their pathline will never intersect, and when they move in different directions, their pathlines will cross only once. 20) The streamlines of the particles in a flow are recorded. If the streamline distribution remains the same even after some time, what type of flow can it be? Unsteady Steady non-uniform uniform Show Answer Workspace Answer: B [ Steady ] Description: A streamline is defined as an imaginary line within the flow such that the tangent at any point on it indicates the velocity at that point. In a steady flow, the momentum of the particles is constant with time. Hence, the streamlines remain the same even after some time. 21) The path taken by the smoke coming out of a chimney (in concentric circles) represents a Streamline Pathline Streamtube Streakline Show Answer Workspace Answer: D [ Streakline ] Description: A pathline is a path followed by a particle in motion, whereas a streamline is an imaginary line within the flow. The tangent at any point on it indicates the velocity at that point. A stream tube is a collection of streamlines. A streakline is a curve that gives an instantaneous picture of the location of the fluid particles which have passed through a given point. Hence, the path taken by the smoke coming out of a chimney (in concentric circles) will represent streaklines. 22) If a liquid enters a pipe of diameter d with a velocity v, what will its velocity at the exit if the diameter reduces to 0.5d? 0.5v V 4v 2v Show Answer Workspace Answer: C [ 4v ] Description: 23) Which method is most commonly used in fluid mechanics for analysis? Eulerian Method Lagrangian method Control volume analysis None of the mentioned Show Answer Workspace Answer: A [ Eulerian Method ] Description: In the Eulerian method, we describe velocity, acceleration pressure, etc., at a point in the flow field. Hence, it is also most commonly used in fluid mechanics. 24) For incompressible fluid flow, if area reduces, then what is the effect on the velocity. Decreases Increases first decreases, then increase first increases, then decrease Show Answer Workspace Answer: B [ Increases ] Description: According to the continuity equation, Area × velocity = constant Hence, as the area decreases, velocity increases. 25) For compressible fluid flow in a pipe, having a decrease in specific gravity, what will be the effect of a reduction in diameter? It will cause a decrease in velocity It will cause an increase in velocity It remains constant None of the mentioned Show Answer Workspace Answer: B [ It will cause an increase in velocity ] Description: According to the continuity equation, ?*A*v = constant Hence, as density and area decrease, velocity is bound to increase. 26) The diameter of a pipe in section 1 is 9 cm. If the velocity of water flowing through the line at section 1 is 4.8 m/s, and section 2 is nine m/s, Determine the area at section 2. 67.86 m2 33.93 m2 38.66 m2 16.96 m2 Show Answer Workspace Answer: B [ 67.86 m2 ] Description: According to continuity equation, Area × velocity = constant Area1*Velocity1 = Area2*Velocity2 (Area1*Velocity1)/Velocity2=Area2 Area 2= 33.93 m2. 27) Which equation must be perfunctorily satisfied while dealing with fluid flow problems? Newton's third law Newton's second law Continuity equation Law of conservation of momentum Show Answer Workspace Answer: C [ Continuity equation ] Description: Continuity equation must be perfunctorily satisfied while dealing with fluid flow problems. 28) When a fluid element moves from one position to another, what type of motion is it?

In this case, it is the weight of the atmosphere and water above 1m. [Formula: P (depth) = Paytm +(density of water*gravitational constant*depth)]. 42) The pressure at any given point of a non-moving fluid is called the _______ Atmospheric Pressure Gauge Pressure Hydrostatic Pressure Differential Pressure Show Answer Workspace Answer: C [ Hydrostatic Pressure ] Description: Hydrostatic pressure varies with the increase in depth. Hydrostatic pressure is measured from the surface of the fluid because of the increasing weight of the liquid. The fluid exerts a downward force from the water's surface, thus making it a non-moving fluid. 43) What type of liquids are measured using a manometer? Medium Liquids Heavy Liquids Heavy and light liquid Light Liquid Show Answer Workspace Answer: D [ Light Liquids ] Description: Measurement of liquid in a manometer takes place through differential pressures by balancing the weight. Thus, it is easier for the manometer to measure liquids of lesser density than the heavier ones.
