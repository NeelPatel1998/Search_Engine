Qlik is a software firm based in Radnor, Pennsylvania (USA). Before 1996, QlikView was called "Quik View." It was a PC based software. Quik was abstracted from a quality, interaction, understanding, and knowledge. Later it is called as QlikView. Its first two versions were written in Excel using VLOOKUPs.

In 2019, QlikTech gets the license from the RBI to operate a liaison office in Bangalore. QlikView Architecture The QlikView architecture consists of front end and back end components and publication mechanism for QlikView user documents. The below diagram illustrates the internal working of QlikView. The front end is used to visualize the processed data, and a Back end is used to provide the security. Front End This is the browser-based access point for end-users. The document can be viewed from the browser-based access point. These documents are the already created BI reports that hosted on the internet by the QlikView. As an end-user, you can access these documents on the Web through the particular URL, which is HTTPS communication. Also, you can access it via QVP, which is QlikView's propriety communication protocol. Then you can interact with that data by making analysis, deriving insights, and then come to a conclusion. You can share these documents and reports with other users, work on it together, and collaborate on the insights gained from the data in real-time. If it is not in real-time, then it can be done offline. These documents are in the .qvw format, and also it can be stored in the Windows OS as a standalone document. Since all the actions happened in the QlikView server is responsible for the client-server communication between the user and the QlikView Back-End system. Back End The back end also consists of three components, such as: QlikView Developers QlikView Publishers QlikView Server All the above components collectively help in designing, developing, and implementations of the QlikView applications. QlikView Developer QlikView Developer or QlikView Desktop is a Windows-based desktop tool which is mostly used by developers or designers. It is used to data extract, load, and transformation, and it also can be used to create a custom GUI layout of reports. The custom GUI can be created through drag and drop functionality, and the same will be reflected in the front-end. The file types which are created by using the Developer are stored with .qvw extension. These files are the same files which are passed through the QlikView server in the Front-End. The .qvw files can be modified to .qvd files, which are data-only files. The data-only files are those files which contain only the data, neither the GUI components nor the reports. QlikView Publisher QlikView which is used as a Publisher is also a back-end component distribution service to distribute the .qvw documents to the various QlikView servers and users. It does data loading, and it is responsible for maintaining user access and privileges as well. It also does direct loading of data from the data sources by using the scripts defined in the .qvw files. The data sources can be Excel files, Data Warehouse, Oracle DB, Salesforce, and various Databases, etc. QlikView Server A QlikView server maintains communication between client and end-users. Applications created in the desktop version are hosted on the QlikView Server (QVS) so that user can access and use them anywhere. QlikView server is supported by a powerful QLX engine which provides efficient in-memory data analysis, distribution, Data management, scaling, consolidation, and data access. This is the QVS server which provides data file from the backend to frontend users. QlikView Management Console The QlikView management console is a platform which centrally manages all other QlikView components. It is a web-based interface and a server-side application which is controlled by IT professionals. QlikView User Access QlikView User Access allows customers to access and manipulate data files. Mostly the access points for the user are web browsers which can be opened using mobile, desktop, laptops, etc. So, when the user opens a document in QlikView and send a request to load the data file, this file fetches by the service from the back end is always in the original format. However, the QlikView created a document by using that file is still in .qvw extension. QlikView Features The below image shows the features of QlikView, such as: 1.
