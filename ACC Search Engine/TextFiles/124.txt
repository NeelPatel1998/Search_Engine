This tutorial gives you an introduction to Automation Anywhere along with a wide range of topics such as why use automation anywhere, history of automation anywhere, automation anywhere architecture, features of automation anywhere, types of automation anywhere, installation, etc. What is Automation? Automation is a technique that is used to complete the tasks with minimal or no human intervention. This technique is used to make devices, systems, or processes to operate automatically. The primary aim of automation is to boost the efficiency of business processes and reduce/replace the human workforce. The word automation and its usage first came into existence after the 1920s. However, it got popularity in the early days of the 1990s. As the term 'automation' speaks, the technique is used to add support for completing different types of repetitive and rule-based tasks such as data entry, invoice processing, etc. To perform these types of tasks, we have to make use of Robotic Process Automation. Automation Anywhere is one of the popular RPA tools that is used to perform such kinds of tedious tasks with ease. RPA or Robotic Process Automation is a technique that uses software to mimic repetitive and rule-based human actions. It allows users to automate the actions on computer systems or other digital devices. The automation can be divided into four different categories, as listed below: Macro Recorders Application-level Macro Recorders Artificial Intelligence Business Process Automation (BPA) Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Automation Anywhere Automation Anywhere is one of the popular RPA tools that provides powerful features to automate complex business tasks. It is used to automate such processes that are repetitive, rule-based, and manually performed by humans. It offers end to end automation strategy for organizations. Automation Anywhere is a web-based management system. It has a Control Room that helps in managing automated tasks. It is mainly used at the enterprise level and changes the way the enterprises operate. The primary aim of Automation Anywhere is to offer scalable, secure, and resilient services to its users. History of Automation Anywhere Automation Anywhere is an RPA tool designed by Automation Anywhere, Inc. The company was initially founded in 2003 under the name Tethys Solutions, LLC. Back in 2010, the name was changed to Automation Anywhere, the company's flagship product name.

Scalable Enterprises can easily and quickly scale up automation in the future using Automation Anywhere. It can be used to scale from Desktop to Data Centre. Automation Anywhere Architecture Automation Anywhere has a distributed architecture. It offers a centralized management system by using its control room. The architecture of Automation Anywhere is separated into two components, Bot Creators and Bot Runners. Both components are attached to the Control Room. Take a look into the following diagram that displays the structural view of Automation Anywhere Architecture: Let's understand more about its components. The core components of Automation Anywhere architecture are: Bot Creators As the name speaks, Bot Creators are used for creating bots. They offer developers a desktop-based application and tools that validate against an active Control Room and help in the creation of bots. The configured code of the bots is stored in the Control Room. Multiple developers can upload, download, or create individual bots/tasks and execute all of them at the same time. Control Room The Control Room is said to be the most important component of the Automation Anywhere architecture. It is a web-based server that deals with the bots created by Bot Creators. It acts as a controller that controls the entire execution and management of clients, scripts, roles, credentials, security, etc. All of the automated tasks/scripts are uploaded in the Control Room. Control Room further manages and schedule the execution of the task in the host server or machine. It also offers features such as user management, source control, license management, automation deployment, and a dashboard: User Management Control Room adds an ability for administrators to manage user access to different systems, applications, or networks. Source Control Control Room helps in the management of the codes for the bots. It makes the sharing of code easier across different systems. License Management Control Room manages the purchased licenses for Automation Anywhere. Automation Anywhere has two types of licenses, such as: Dev License: This license allows access to create, edit, and run a bot. Run License: This license allows access only to run a bot. We cannot create or alter a bot. Automation Deployment Control Room provides options for the deployment of automation bots. Dashboard A dashboard provides full insights of Automation Anywhere bots. It also displays the number of running bots, failed bots and passed bots, etc. Bot Runners The Bot Runner is a set of machine-level code that is used to execute the bots. Several bots can be simultaneously executed. To run the bots, Run License is required. Bot Runners are run-time clients that are usually installed on windows based systems. The Bot Runner can report back the execution status to the control room. Other Important Products of Automation Anywhere Some other important products of Automation Anywhere are: Bot Insights Bot Insight is a tool that allows users to analyze the performance of bots. It displays graphs and statistics to measure each bot's performance. It also enables users to calculate the time that a user has saved with the automation. It is said to be the first analytics solution used for bots. Bot Insights uses real-time business insights with digital workforce performance. Bot Farm Bot Farm is a tool used for the expansion of the number of RPA bots. It is integrated with the Enterprise edition of Automation Anywhere. Bot Farm can also scale the capacity of the digital workforce with a single-click deployment anytime from anywhere. It allows users to develop, deploy, and manage hundreds or thousands of bots, ensuring the elasticity and scalability. Bot Store Bot Store is the first digital marketplace that contains several pre-built bots for different business automation tasks. It allows enterprises to deploy different bots such as application bots, process bots, and cognitive bots in a short period. Types of Bots in Automation Anywhere There are three types of bots used in Automation Anywhere: Task bot Meta bot IQ bot Task Bots Task bots are bots that are used to automate rule-based, repetitive tasks. Task bots are usually beneficial in document administration, claims management, HR department, IT, etc. They enhance productivity, error reduction, and cost-saving. Meta Bots Meta bots are known as automation building blocks that facilitate scalability with next-generation integration. These are designed for complex, scalable processes. If there is a requirement of any change in the process, we have to perform some edits to the bot. The changes will be automatically applied to all the processes linked with that specific bot. IQ Bots IQ Bot is an advanced tool that includes the capability of thinking like a human. IQ bots are also referred to as Cognitive bots. These bots are developed to learn on their own and perform the tasks according to it. IQ bots use advanced cognitive technology and advanced artificial technologies that enable users to experience the power of automation. These bots include features like self-learning, decision making, and subject matter expertise, etc. These bots can extract data from semi-structured and unstructured data. Automation Anywhere Features Automation Anywhere has several unique features that make it notable amongst RPA tools. Check out the following important functionalities available in this RPA tool: Task Editor Automation Anywhere allows users to generate tasks with the help of a task editor. The task editor provides a toolbox, and users can easily drag and drop the items from the toolbox to generate a task. Task editor also allows users to edit, modify, break down, or improve the recorded tasks. The task editor has more than 380 actions. Some of the important actions are Windows Actions, Database Actions, Files/Folder Actions, Conditional Actions, Keyboard & Mouse Actions, Internet Actions, Loop Actions, and Clipboard Actions. Workflow Designer This feature allows enterprises to create simple, easy to understand graphical-interface of the business processes. It is used to automate multiple tasks in a queue, including alternate path locations, that is executed when there is any failure in the primary process execution. Report Designer This feature allows users to generate and print the insight that displays the statistics of the execution logs of any particular task. It can also be used to create custom reports or insights. The report designer provides options such as Workflow Timeline, Task Timeline, Task Run, Visual Logs, and ROI reports, etc. Trigger Manager Trigger manager is used for processing any task or workflow based on the other process, service, or task such as start/stop, system change, file or folder change, etc. Workload Management This feature is used to prioritize the process for execution. Workload management (WLM) allows enterprises to manually set the high-value processes inside the automated queue to fulfill the enterprise's requirements. It uses hundreds or thousands of software bots to satisfy the demand and ensures better optimization for process automation. Recorders It is one of the top features of Automation Anywhere. It allows enterprises to record, save, and test their actions. It follows the user's actions and creates a bot according to it. There are no programming skills required to develop bots as recording any task is more straightforward than manually coding it. There are three types of recording option available in Automation Anywhere: Smart Recorder: It is used to capture whole actions, just like object cloning. Screen Recorder: It is used to capture actions like mouse clicks and movements, keyboard operations, etc. Web Recorder: It is used for extracting data from the web. It accurately records user-actions and further automates web-based tasks without the requirement of any coding or programming language. Image Recognition and OCR Image recognition is used to read objects of an image as well as compare it with other images. It can also read or recognize an image from any document or the entire web page. Similarly, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) recognizes an image and converts the image data into text or characters in an excellent way. These are the important features present in Automation Anywhere. Apart from that, there are several other features such as lifecycle management, operational analytic, Citrix automation, visualization, screen scraping, web data extraction, centralized backup, security, data recovery, etc. What Processes we can automate with Automation Anywhere? Almost all the repetitive and rule-based digital processes can be controlled by Automation Anywhere. It uses GUI to control the processes just like a human. It can also automate complex processes and efficiently complete them. Some of the important processes that can be automated using Automation Anywhere are: Data extraction and submission Data comparison and validation All windows and web-based user actions Navigation through web, windows, cloud, legacy systems Rule-based decisions Note- Hand-written data and non-rule based judgment calls cannot be automated by Automation Anywhere.
