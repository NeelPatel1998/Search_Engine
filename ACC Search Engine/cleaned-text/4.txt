million years ago volcanoes present earth existence also noticed worlds planets extremely active jupiter even also believed moon mars volcanoes long dormant general know volcanoes specific types mountains spit hot materials various types volcanoes researchers constantly learning article discusses different types volcanoes basic characteristics also help us differentiate different volcanoes before discussing various volcano types let us first briefly overview volcanoes formed what volcanoes definition volcano refers opening earths surface molten rocks originate beneath surface more specifically earths surface combination several tectonic plates spreading apart crunching one another sliding beside one another volcanoes usually formed fault lines tectonic plates molten rock gases escape vent earth volcanic mountain openings typically meet pool molten rocks earths surface vent volcanoes typically different sizes heights slope steepness some volcanoes tall coneshaped mountains cracks ground different characteristics volcanoes typically depend composition molten rocks volcanic eruptions usually produce lateral eruptions hot ash lava mudslides etc besides many volcanic activities form erupted magma activities sometimes responsible various distinctive landforms lets take quick overview volcanoes form earth how volcanoes formed rigid rock body known mantle found deep beneath earth hard rock usually located molten iron core thin layer surface extremely high temperatures excess amounts pressure apply force solid rocks melt convert liquid rock called magma when mantles rocks melt due hot conditions magma moves towards eraths surface crust various pentup gases released eventually results volcanoes magma volcanoes usually rises dense rock layers reaches surface once magma reaches surface referred lava note biggest volcano earth named mauna loa comprises around cubic kilometers materials additionally tallest volcano earth mauna kea around meters sea level around meters seafloor part volcanoes making big island hawaii types volcanoes different types volcanoes formed based magmas stickiness viscosity amounts presence gases magma method following magma reaches surface each type volcano usually varies volcanic materials produces shape structure size effects volcanoes typically grouped four major types cinder cone composite shield lava domes let us discuss volcano type detail cinder cone volcanoes cinder cone volcanoes often referred spatter cones scoria cones volcanoes basic simplest types volcanoes volcanoes usually formed coneshaped structure start form small particles blobs lava eject single volcanic vent lava charged air breaks apart small pieces small pieces go far rain around vent cinders collected cinders form oval cone circular shape structure around vent moreover cinder cones usually bowlshaped crater pit summit since formed loose cinder particles strong erased easily quickly apart cinder cone volcanoes relatively small height around feet typically rise feet however steep sides grow feet around surroundings typically depends composition lava ejected corresponding volcano cinder cone volcanoes form months years besides usually erupt formed single volcanoes may occur secondary volcanoes called parasitic cones flank vents larger volcanoes surrounding areas composite volcanoes composite volcanoes commonly termed stratovolcanoes volcanoes made multiple layers different materials highviscosity lava flow ash stone blocks viscosity lava indicates volcanoes typically explode eruption much higher cinder cone volcanoes may rise feet composite volcanoes formed conical mountains containing lava flows ejecta alternating layers particular composite volcanoes formed cinders ash lava cinders ash randomly pile top one another allowing lava flow mixed ash top once composition cools hardens process repeatedly occurs forming steepsided volcanos composite volcanos furthermore make structure underground conduits means usually crater summit central vent contain group vents therefore explode may blow crater cones sides shield volcanoes shield volcanoes received name unique shape typically bowlshape shield top middle long gentle slopes formed basaltic lava flows volcanoes erupt thin lava extends directions middle vent although volcanoes generally steeps relatively large covering vast areas wide bases shield volcanoes even cover several miles diameter including flatter summit steeper middle slopes furthermore volcanoes usually dont erupt catastrophically shield volcanoes build slowly time typically formed several eruptions create multiple layers some largest volcanoes earth shield volcanoes examples include mauna kea mauna loa rising kilometers seafloor lava domes volcanoes volcanic lava domes formed small masses lava known viscous thick flow far unlike volcanoes shielded lowviscosity lava magmas lava domes pile around vent lava within dome rises expanses material emanating sides dome forms rising mountains violent eruptions occur lava domes causing massive amounts hot rock ash sometimes formed within crater previous volcanic eruptions like combined volcano produce violent explosive eruptions lava generally emanate far point origin soufrière hills volcano caribbean island montserrat well known lava dome complex volcanos summit gone phases growth collapse categories volcanoes mainly three categories volcanoes divided active volcanoes active volcanoes refer volcanoes recently erupted likely erupt soon dormant volcanoes dormant volcanoes refer volcanoes erupted long time likely erupt soon extinct volcanoes extinct volcanoes refer volcanoes erupted thousands years ago unlikely erupt next topickubernetes vs docker prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please
